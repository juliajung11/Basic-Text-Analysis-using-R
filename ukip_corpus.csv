Voters will be asked ‘Should the United Kingdom remain a member of the European Union? when they go to the polls for the in/out referendum  it has been confirmed.  In response UKIP Leader Nigel Farage said:  It is a simple straightforward  unambiguous question. That much is clear.   However that Cameron is opting to give the pro-EU side the positive  Yes  suggests strongly that his negotiations are so much fudge. He has already decided which way he wants the answer to be given  without a single power repatriated. 
UKIP Deputy Leader Paul Nuttall MEP: “Sepp Blatter’s position as FIFA president was already on shaky ground but now surely no one will argue that it is in any way tenable.  “Pretty much all of the crimes being alleged happened on his watch. If he knew about it  then he should be prosecuted. If he didn’t know about it  then he wasn’t doing his job properly and should be removed.   Grassroots football in some of the world’s poorest countries and fans everywhere are the apparent victims of these crimes.  “Only a root and branch clear out at FIFA will satisfy them that we’re cleaning up the game once and for all.”
UKIP MEP Louise Bours said:  The EU continues to suffer economic and unemployment disaster yet the EC wastes taxpayers  money to decide how much coffee adults should drink.   This study by the EU food safety quango is absurd and wasteful. Its findings are patronising for pregnant women. They have medical advice. They don t need bossy Brussels. 
Draft European Union (Referendum) Bill does not guarantee a free and fair referendum  says UKIP Chairman Steve Crowther. Read more here: http://www.ukip.org/bill_does_not_guarantee_a_free_and_fair_referendum_says_ukip_chairman
EU enabling trafficking of girls through open borders says Louise Bours MEP
UKIP Chairman Steve Crowther said: “The European Referendum Bill fails to mandate a period of ‘purdah’  normal in elections  to prevent the government from making announcements in the run-up which might affect the result.  “With no guarantee from the Government that they will set and enforce fair and equal spending limits  this omission leaves the door open for the government or indeed the European Union’s agencies to make ever more appealing announcements  right up to polling day  to ‘nudge’ people towards a vote to stay in.”  “The people have waited 40 years for this opportunity and they must be given a free  fair and open choice to decide whether we stay in the EU  or reclaim our ability to govern ourselves. The government will not be forgiven if they play tricks with it.”
UKIP s Jonathan Arnott MEP s top 5 reasons to leave the European Union. What s your top 5?  Leave your top 5 in the comments below...
UKIP Leader Nigel Farage:  The UK would be better off out of the European Union. Better able to trade freely and fairly with the wider world  better because it could set its own rules to suit its own circumstances  better because we would be able to elect and dismiss our Government  rather than accept the governance of an unelected bureaucracy.   Agree? Then why not join UKIP  the only party that believes Britain is more than a star on somebody else s flag.
Read: Nigel Farage s latest #FarageOnFriday article.  The EU referendum is not about benefits  it’s about who governs Britain.
What this Referendum is really about isn’t the details of benefits policy  but about who governs Britain - Nigel Farage.  If you agree  why not LIKE & SHARE this post to spread the word.
Labour s battle with UKIP in Wales - UKIP has come from nowhere to now challenge Labour across Wales  Sam Gould who led the successful UKIP Caerphilly campaign said  We ve only been organised as a party for a matter of three months [in Caerphilly] and so for us to get to 20% of the vote after only organising ourselves and running a three month campaign is tremendous. So what can we do in a year?   Give UK Independence Party (UKIP) Wales. a like to keep up to date with our campaigns there!
UKIP leader Nigel Farage: “Today is the 10th anniversary of the Dutch people categorically rejecting the EU constitution in 2005. It is fair to ask  has the EU learned anything in the meantime? Obviously not  for not only were the Dutch and French voters ignored  but the Irish No vote to Lisbon was also dismissed.   By chance  the Greek Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras last night accused the Eurozone’s dominant players of incrementally bringing the ‘complete abolition of democracy in Europe’ and ushering in a technocratic monstrosity. How right he is. 
UKIP Leader Nigel Farage has today reiterated his position on the problems caused by health tourism to the NHS.   Though many in the Westminster bubble were outraged by my comments about the impact of Health Tourism  and appalled that I mentioned those with HIV as part of that problem  what was clear was that the general public did not share that outrage.   Immediately after the debate YouGov carried out a poll that showed that a full 50% of the population agreed with me  with only 34% opposed. I also received very moving messages of support from UK sufferers of HIV who have found it increasingly hard to receive the treatment they need because of pressure on clinics.  “There is obviously some misunderstanding as to UKIP’s position on this. We believe firmly in the NHS. Not the International Health Service. We believe that anybody moving to this country should be in possession of health insurance which covers them for forthcoming health care. If they have that insurance  then they will not have the detrimental impact on NHS budgets and services that mean that at times UK citizens find it difficult to access that which they and their families have built up over the generations. Most countries in the world  such as the US and Australia  have a similar policy and they are not regarded as in any way selfish  merely sensible. 
Today Young Independence  UKIP s youth organisation has elected a new Chairman Joseph Jenkins. There are now over 3500 members in Young Independence which has grown over 100% under the last YI Council.  Party Chairman Steve Crowther said:  I am delighted to see Joe taking over as Young Independence Chairman. He has done great work in launching UKIP Students in August which now has over 30 University Societies. In May he stood up for Students across the country and took on Nick Clegg in Sheffield Hallam. I would like also to thank the former YI Chairman Jack Duffin and the rest of the Council who have built YI into a very professional organisation with substantial membership growth. 
The President of the European Council  Jean-Claude Juncker has waded into the EU referendum question in the UK and announced that the people of the UK have no “desire” for leaving the EU and that David Cameron “wants to dock his country permanently to Europe”.  Nigel Farage the UKIP leader said   The British people are fed up to the back teeth with Eurocrats telling us what we want  what is good for us  how to run our businesses and how we organise our society.   Now he tells us we do not want to run our own lives. Of course this man  elected from a short-list of one  with no popular democratic mandate and no means of accountability wants to maintain the control of the unelected unwanted Eurocrats. Well he would  wouldn’t he? Mr Juncker should wind his neck in about what the British people want or do not want  he does not know us. 
Diane James MEP  UKIP’s Justice and Home Affairs spokeswoman  “The inconsistencies and dishonesty of the Tory position is today becoming clear to all as Gove and May have a public spat with the Prime Minister.  “The plain facts are  while we are members of the EU the UK must be signatories of the ECHR and our Supreme Court is subservient to the European Court in Strasbourg on human rights matters.  “Only UKIP s plan to pull out of the EU and ECHR can deliver the necessary change the British people need and want.”
UKIP Defence Spokesman  Mike Hookem MEP  has said comments on the UK defence budget by the US Defence Secretary  Ashton Carter are “hugely concerning for the future of the ‘special relationship’” and has expressed “great anxiety” at news of yet more Tory defence cuts in the new parliament.  “Time and again before the election  UKIP warned that the Conservatives were going to make a further attack on defence spending if they won power. This was obvious from their sheer lack of commitment to meet the NATO spending target of 2% of GDP on defence.”   “The simple fact is that Britain’s armed forces are already starved of much needed resources and further cuts would seriously hamper the UK’s ability to respond to the constantly evolving world security situation. More cuts would also seriously harm the vital humanitarian work that Britain’s armed forces do around the globe.”
William Dartmouth MEP  who represents the Rock in the European Parliament said  “I am very sad to learn of the resignation of the Governor of Gibraltar  Sir James Dutton. I share his obviously deep sense of frustration at discovering that our Foreign Office regarded his job as little more than ceremonial. He is a man who has taken his responsibility to the Rock and its people with the utmost seriousness.   As Governor he represents Her Majesty the Queen directly and not the British government and his role is to be responsible for external affairs  internal security and defence. It is not a job that can be second guessed by a Foreign office bureaucrat. Nor indeed a Government that seems to be more concerned about pandering to Spain. It is doing this as part of its tactical manoeuvring to obtain European Union reform than it is to standing up for the interests and safety of Gibraltar.   The Military importance of Gibraltar is higher now than it has been in decades  with the growth of Islamist terrorism in the Maghreb and the current migration crisis in the Mediterranean. Now is not the time to downgrade the Rock or its Governor .
Prisoners in Britain may be given the vote because of David Cameron s refusal to pull out of the European Convention on Human Rights  a leading QC and adviser to the Conservative Party has warned.  Diane James MEP  UKIP’s Justice and Home Affairs spokeswoman:  The UKIP position is there should be a blanket ban of votes for prisoners. The problem is  if we continue to be members of the EU and as a consequence  signed up to the ECHR  I have little doubt  votes for prisoners  will be forced upon us.   If the ECHR does force the UK to give votes to prisoners it will be a huge slap in the face to the British democratic process and once again signals the UK cannot escape this ECHR supremacy while we are signed-up members of the EU. 
Today at a European Policy Centre event Nicola Sturgeon  First Minister of Scotland  stated that the Scottish government would be pushing for a double lock mechanism for the EU referendum  whereby a Scottish majority would be required for Scotland to leave.  David Coburn UKIP MEP for Scotland  who spoke at the event  said   This is just havers of nonsense. Typical SNP gerrymandering of the democratic process  last time they excluded Scots working abroad and serving in the forces  now they want to include any EU national living in Scotland.   We came into the EU as one United Kingdom  we came into the EU together  so we will leave together. The Scottish people clearly decided that they wanted to remain as part of the United Kingdom so any talk of this double lock mechanism makes a mockery of the Scottish people s decision. We respected the result  now they must too. 
UKIP Deputy Leader Paul Nuttall MEP:  I m delighted that Sepp  Blatter is finally going  and it’s not before time.   The process of cleaning up FIFA can now begin  and although it will take some time  we will eventually be able to put pride back into what is  after all our national game.   Although he has announced today he is going  he will remain in post for the next 6 months until a new election can take place. With all the damage he has done to the game globally over the years  I think everyone would like to see him go now  so the recovery can start immediately.”
UKIP’s Transport spokesman Jill Seymour MEP: “Mr McLoughlin  the Transport Secretary  is delusional in thinking that winning the general election is down to the support for HS2.    He totally ignores the valid views of individuals who have already lost value on their properties and left them  in some situations  feeling desperate. Nothing has changed these past few weeks. HS2 still has no proven business case  and the eventual cost of the project is anyone’s guess – it seems to go up every week.  “The comments made by Mr McLoughlin prove that the Tory government is still not listening to those affected by this line  and doesn’t care about racking up a debt which will take generations to pay off  and which Britain simply cannot afford.”
UKIP MP Douglas Carswell: “I may be my party’s only voice in the House of Commons  but I shall speak on behalf of not only my constituents  but the millions who voted for my party. I may have only one vote in the Division Lobby  but I shall use it to support Ministers when they do sensible things  to oppose the Government when they are being daft  and  when I think it is possible to improve things  to try to amend things to make them better.”  Read more here: http://www.ukip.org/douglas_carswell_i_speak_for_millions_in_westminster
UKIP s Jonathan Arnott MEP said:  The EU Commission’s financial control is useless and tens of billions of pounds are lost through mismanagement and dishonesty. This lack of control makes it much easier for fraudsters to get their sticky fingers on the money - a staggering £55million a day of which comes from the UK.   Every day we find more and more reasons why we urgently need a referendum so we can escape the tentacles of the EU and get back our sovereignty and keep our taxpayers money in our own country.

UKIP Leader Nigel Farage:  This time last year everyone said I was wrong. Number of Romanians given right to work in UK up 223%. Number of Bulgarians given right to work in UK up by more than 120%. 
UKIP MEP Steven Woolfe MEP:  UKIP do not have to kowtow to the outside bodies like unions or corporate sponsors which traditionally anchor political parties on the left or right. We debate those issues that may compromise our principles even though the outcome may be detrimental to our party - UKIP s discussions and the outcome over so-called short money is a case in point. We are a democratic party that believes in ideas - ideas which are likely to be best for the people of this country  and which will lower the cost of living and increase real wages. That’s not Left or Right; it’s just UKIP. 
UKIP Deputy Leader Paul Nuttall MEP: “It is rarely mentioned in the media but three EU Postal Services Directives lie behind the destruction of the Royal Mail. UKIP opposed these which were implemented initially by Labour while in government.  “Under EU state aid rules the UK Government is strictly forbidden from helping the Royal Mail with taxpayers’ money and this means that in future it could go bust and completely disappear.  “This final part of the privatisation means we will be left with a completely destroyed Royal Mail  once a proud British institution that did so much more than just deliver letters. We can thank the EU for that.  “Even if it does survive I fear that Royal Mail could well end up 100% in foreign ownership  just like much of our utility companies and railways. What a sad outcome for this historic business.”
Britain’s fracking revolution could be blown off course — after the anti-fracking SNP was awarded control of the key House of Commons Energy Select Committee. Referring to the weaver whose name was given to workers smashing machinery 200 years ago  UKIP MP Douglas Carswell said the appointment was like putting “Ned Ludd in charge of the industrial revolution”.  Douglas Carswell told The Sun: “It’s a bad thing because Parliament should be making the case for this bountiful supply of new cheap energy  but I suspect what will happen is that the committee will just issue angry luddite reports and will become an irrelevance.

UKIP Health Spokesman Louise Bours MEP: The future of the National Health Service is under serious threat in the European Parliament next week - yet UKIP is the only major British political party prepared to defend it.  In Strasbourg on Wednesday  the European Parliament will take a vote on the proposed Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP) with the USA. UKIP is of course in favour of free trade  but TTIP is a corporatist stitch-up and it should be for the British people to decide their stance on this vital issue.
UKIP s Tim Aker MEP:  Don t believe the  eurosceptics  who are still holding out for a deal from David Cameron. The campaign to leave the EU needs Nigel Farage at its head.

UKIP Leader Nigel Farage:  Join my campaign to leave the EU and get our country back.   It is time for those across the political spectrum  particularly in the Conservative Party  to put their cards on the table. No more endless waiting  political hand-wringing or excuses. The campaign must start now. We are prepared to work with anyone and everyone who is willing to help us win this referendum and get Britain out of the European Union.   SHARE this to spread the word!
In his first major speech since the General Election UKIP Leader  Nigel Farage has said it was time to  get cracking  on the campaign to win back Britain s independence.  There is no time to lose and little point waiting for the results of Cameron s negotiations  which are likely to be a stitch-up compromise of associate membership.  Speaking at the UKIP South East Conference in Eastbourne Nigel Farage said  We cannot afford to wait until Cameron comes back with his piece of paper  from his EU negotiations.  Nigel Farage made it clear that  UKIP would do everything it can to get back control of our country  and would be an important part of the campaign the Party not least because of the existing organisational and regional structure but also the membership base and scores of activists ready and able to properly conduct a ground campaign across the length and breadth of the country to get us out of the EU.  Will you be joining us in our fight to win back Britain s independence?
Mediterranean migrant crisis shows the urgent need for border controls to ensure the security of our country says UKIP Leader Nigel Farage
UKIP Leader Nigel Farage:  It is perfectly clear that Mr. Cameron does not want this to be full  free and fair referendum  given that he is threatening his own Ministers rather than allowing MPs to campaign according to their own conscience. As Ministers were in the last European Referendum campaign 1975.  “The Prime Minister is committing to campaigning to remain inside the EU before his so-called renegotiation has even taken place. Cameron clearly wants to keep Britain inside the EU under any circumstances.   Read more here: http://www.ukip.org/blocking_dissent_and_buying_the_vote

In a devastating judgement affecting the cost of energy efficiency in homes  the European Court of Justice last week forbade the UK from rating energy efficiency items at 5%  but instead demanded that they be rated at a much higher 20% for all bar social housing.  Andrew Charalambous  the UKIP housing spokesman said   On one hand the EU is pressing for greater energy efficiency on the other it is making the cost of energy efficiency much greater.   The real loser is the British tenant  because in reality this added cost will translate into higher rents. You cannot apply uniformity across countries who do not enjoy uniform circumstances. There is no logical reason why the UK needs to increase the level of VAT for energy efficiency products simply to stay in line with other countries who themselves have completely different private rental markets.

UKIP Deputy Leader Paul Nuttall MEP; UKIP have consistently demanded that the British people should be finally given a say on our membership of the EU and it was precisely the growing support for that which spooked Cameron and forced him to include it in his election manifesto. Yet he remains consistently inconsistent on the whole issue.  The only party that 100% believes Britain is more than a star on someone else s flag and believes we should leave the EU is UKIP!

UKIP Defence Spokesman Mike Hookem MEP has blasted a suggestion by Conservative defence minister Michael Fallon that the entire foreign aid and defence budgets be merged  calling it “ludicrous”.  “There are people’s lives on the line and it is about time the Government started adequately funding our armed forces. The British people do not want to see more of their money spent on foreign aid when our troops are poorly equipped and veterans are left abandoned after service.  “Enough is enough. Some things are more important than Cameron’s foreign aid vanity project  and protecting our armed forces is one of them.”
BREAKING NEWS: Debate and vote in European Parliament on TTIP suspended.   UKIP Leader Nigel Farage speaking to Breitbart London: “In 17 years in the European Parliament  I’ve never seen anything like this ” he said  remarking on the scramble amongst EU chiefs to postpone the vote  and the debate which were due to take place at 8am today.  “They’re in blind panic. I’ve never seen anything like it. Finally there seems to be a crack in the corporatist stitch up. Even the Labour Party  after years of having backed this thing  seem to now realise what they’ve done  what a big  corporatist deal they’ve been backing.”
Today Nigel Farage said:  In my 17 years as an MEP I ve never received so much communication from the public on a proposed piece of legislation. The TTIP has concerned millions of people across the European Union. They have bombarded their MEPs with phone calls  letters and emails and in response to this the EU is now running scared.

UKIP Migration Spokesman Steven Woolfe MEP: Proposals put to the Migration Advisory Committee are a smoke screen. It is a classic case of talking the talk  but when reality kicks  they fail to walk the walk on immigration.   Although these proposals sets out tougher restrictions on Non EEA Work Migration  they are failing to tackle work migration from inside the EU. This is because  any government of any colour  can not control any category of migration from inside the EU. The current EU president  Juncker has already made clear that  Free movement  of people inside the European Union is non negotiable in future negotiations between the EU and Britain and will remain indefinitely. 
Do you agree with Tim Aker MEP?  We do not need to be part of the EU to trade with it.
UKIP Deputy Leader Paul Nuttall MEP has today written to Lord Hall  Director-General of the BBC  pointing out that the corporation does not disclose in its coverage of the EU the tens of millions of pounds which it receives from the European Commission:  An examination of the European Commission s website discloses that between 2007 and 2013 the BBC received €30.2m  approximately £22.1m  from the commission. Millions more have been paid since.    The debate on the referendum of Britain s membership of the EU is clearly one in which the BBC has a duty to observe impartiality in its coverage. I am concerned however that the BBC  should it continue on present form  will fail in this duty. 
UKIP Leader Nigel Farage:  In over 16 years as an MEP  I’ve never seen such a vast amount of emails  correspondence  even members of the public phoning my office in Strasbourg as I have recently over the issue of the Trans-Atlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP).   Whilst TTIP may masquerade as being about free trade  actually it’s not. It’s about harmonisation  standardisation and a market place in which the giant corporates can dominate.

As the grandees of the EU celebrate the 30th anniversary of the open-border Schengen Agreement  it s flaws are laid open on the Italian /French border as both country s police forces go into action to block migrants from travelling across the EU.  Italian police in riot gear forced back into Italy hundreds of migrants near the border town of Ventimiglia  as France refused the migrants entry pouring contempt on the champagne and speeches in Luxembourg celebrating the Treaty s success.  Mike Hookem MEP  UKIP security spokesman said   The closing of the Schengen border between France and Italy proves what UKIP have been saying: there is a security threat from having unmanned borders and this is one Isis have said they will be exploiting.   We cannot have the UK s border starting at Italy and other southern European countries who are inundated with asylum and immigration request because it puts us at the mercy of people traffickers and terrorist groups. 
UKIP MEP Steven Woolfe MEP: “It’s simply shocking to see the numbers already here. “It’s not a camp anymore it’s a ghetto  a thriving community and staging post for getting to the UK.  “They don’t want to stay in Italy  Germany or France because they see Britain as the only place where it’s easy for them to get jobs  healthcare and benefits – and we have heard that from their own mouths.  “They say Britain is the only place they feel they can go and live. They know once they’re there they can settle  bring their families and will not be removed. Our leaky borders encourage people to come here.  “Until we find a strong solution on dealing with asylum seekers and illegal immigrants this will continue.”
UKIP Leader Nigel Farage: “At a time when we criticise Fifa for the way that it manages itself perhaps we ought to look towards our own conduct in this referendum. I think what the government is proposing is an absolute disgrace.   “I have been calling for a full  free and fair referendum … The government’s behaviour to date is even worse than I could have ever imagined.”   “I find it a great irony that David Cameron criticised Sepp Blatter in the way that he did and now has embarked on a project to tilt the playing field.”

UKIP Deputy Leader Paul Nuttall MEP:  One of UKIP’s many attributes is that our supporters are real people  from real places  speaking real words  about real matters. We are not Oxbridge hybrids endlessly spouting whatever we think or hope the few people who buy the Guardian want to hear. It’s not rocket science. It’s called common sense. Something we as a political party uniquely recommend on a daily basis.   Then you have Labour – a party perhaps not in its death throes just yet  but seemingly determined to do everything in its rapidly diminishing power to get there anyway. Just as with the disastrous Miliband  can you picture any of these would-be leaders negotiating anything with Vladimir Putin?   Can you imagine any of them reining in Jeb Bush or Hillary Clinton  determined on a reckless foreign intervention? They are all renouncing Miliband like a bad smell but it was literally just six weeks ago when they were singing his praises and heartily agreed with his policies. And they wonder why people are turning away from Labour to UKIP…

The end to new onshore wind farm subsidies from next April has been welcomed by UKIP Deputy Leader Paul Nuttall MEP.   Wind power has never been the answer to Britain s energy needs and it is iniquitous that householders have been forced to contribute towards this madness.

These subsidies benefit wealthy developers and investors and penalise energy users. Many householders are struggling to make ends meet while the fat cats just get fatter.

UKIP’s Gerard Batten MEP: “As so often before when the European Union passes its laws it ignores the law of unintended consequences. This attempt to restrict the Freedom of Panorama  by allies of the Lib-Dems in Brussels  strikes at the root of our liberties.  “The London Eye: blocked. The Eiffel Tower: stripped out. The Angel of the North: deleted. Art and photography are valuable because of their intrinsic freedom. Freedom constantly undermined by the European Union.”
Decision to bundle peacekeeping costs in with defence spending is  little more than creative accounting  says UKIP defence spokesman Mike Hookem MEP.  Mr Hookem said the move was  another go at trying to cover up defence cuts by fudging the figures.   They tried to make up the 2% target with foreign aid and with the military pensions and now it s the turn of peacekeeping. Our view is that the defence budget should be spent on troops  equipment and essential care such as decent housing and healthcare for personnel and their families. Anything else is an insult to the Armed Forces and the voters  intelligence. 
Moves in the European Parliament to restrict the traditional ‘Freedom of Panorama’ would mean photographers  artists and filmmakers would have to seek permissions and even have to pay to be able film  paint and photograph some of Europe’s most iconic landmarks.  Gerard Batten  UKIP MEP for London said   This is another case of breath-taking idiocy  and will result in unintended consequences  caused by incompetent  ill thought out and unnecessary legislation. It will destroy an explicit British freedom guaranteed in our copyright legislation for over 100 years.The world functions perfectly well without this restrictive suggestion .

TTIP is a corporatist scam and not a real free trade deal  says UKIP’s Douglas Carswell.  We as a party believe that free trade between people is the surest way to greater prosperity. However  TTIP is not a free trade deal  but one that favours big multinational corporates over the interests of smaller businesses  and most importantly the democratic right of people to set policy through elections.  TTIP as it currently stands could hand the NHS lock  stock  and barrel to huge corporations against the wishes of the British people.
UKIP MEPs Jane Collins and Tim Aker MEP have today condemned a move by Conservative MEPs to have all UK jobs advertised across the EU  they said:  UKIP is appalled that Conservative MEPs are supporting legislation which would make it compulsory for all British jobs  apprenticeships and training programmes to appear on a European Commission website aimed at workers across the EU.   The website  called EURES  tells anyone in the EU who wants to work in the UK that there are 850 Eurocrat advisers available to them  to provide information  advice and recruitment/placement (job-matching) services  in Britain. The amendment which Cameron s Conservatives have tabled says that any job  apprenticeship or training programme advertised in the UK be put into this EURES system.   The Tories clearly don t believe in controlling immigration. Only UKIP is on the side of British workers.

UKIP Deputy Leader Paul Nuttall MEP:  Let me make this clear  TTIP is a corporatist scam which will hurt workers  consumers  patients  farmers and small business. It gives unfair advantage to large corporations. It is a lobbyists dream.   There are 30 000 lobbyists here in Brussels - that s over 40 per MEP.  There are more lobbyists here than there are in Washington DC and therefore it s no surprise to me that the big groups in this parliament support TTIP.   People who are concerned about the damaging effects of TTIP should put aside their political differences we should stand united against this secretive stitch up. 
UKIP Leader Nigel Farage on the developing situation in Calais:  As a regular traveller by car through Calais  I ve seen first hand a marked deterioration in the situation around the port.   This will only get worse as huge numbers of people continue to cross the Mediterranean to Europe in response to a clear EU message that nobody will be sent back.   The UK has become the number one destination of choice due to the size of our employment black market and the failure to deport the vast majority of identified illegal immigrants. David Cameron s words at PMQ s today will not deter a single illegal immigrant from trying to break into a car or a lorry. 
UKIP Deputy Leader Paul Nuttall MEP:  This latest about-turn by Labour is astonishing. They were shell shocked to lose an election they thought they had in the bag when voters they have long taken for granted turned to UKIP instead.  “It is meaningless given that Labour will still be run by and for a Hampstead London elite  and Labour has already set its face against English MPs voting alone on English only laws.  “Even Andy Burnham has admitted today that Labour is run by posh people – that Labour only really like posh people. But this is not a new phenomenon – the Labour party has been operating like that for years and the British people have realised that and voted in their masses for UKIP instead.  “This is nothing more than a cynical attempt to appeal to the Old Labour voters who have deserted Labour in their hundreds of thousands to UKIP.”

UKIP Employment spokesman Jane Collins:  The  Ab Fab  generation and baby boomers are  in general  set up nicely with significant increases in the value of properties  final salary pensions and politicians desperate to secure their vote with pro pensioner policies.   Meanwhile young people have to save for years to get a deposit on a house  many working professionals in their 30s and 40s don t have a pension because they can t afford it and look at what their parents have and wonder how they can achieve the same level.   The main way they can combat this is by engaging in the political process  voting and making politicians pay attention to their needs instead of using their future earnings to buy their parents votes.   In the General Election we saw increasing numbers of younger people - particularly working couples - voting UKIP because they saw that we were trying to address the inequalities which are occurring.

UKIP MP Douglas Carswell writing for The Telegraph:   The rest of Europe knows that Mr Cameron is bluffing. The Prime Minister wants to keep Britain in the EU  and is willing to do so at almost any price.   That means that for Frau Merkel and co there is no need to budge.

Read this weeks #FarageOnFriday.  Nigel Farage:  I’ve been at the EU summit over the past few days and I don’t sense any congeniality left whatsoever.    There were three main things on the agenda. Greece was the first and was debated endlessly. The second element of disharmony is on the migrant crisis. The third and last item on the agenda was the attempted British “renegotiation”. 
Mike Hookem MEP  UKIP defence spokesman has described today’s terrorist attacks in Tunisia  France and Kuwait as “the work of utter cowards” and said that his thoughts are with “all those caught up in these dreadful events”.
A message from UKIP Leader Nigel Farage:  Happy #ArmedForcesDay. Thank you to all who have served in our Armed Forces. I hope everyone involved enjoys the day. 
UKIP Defence Spokesman  Mike Hookem MEP  has encouraged the entire country to “get behind our armed forces and their families  even in a small way” and thank them “for their sacrifices in defending our culture  our way of life and our freedoms”.  Speaking after laying a wreath at the National Arboretum for Armed Forces Day 2015  Mike said; “In these times  when our national security is threatened by a wide range of aggressors  it is important to pay tribute to those who put themselves in harms way to defend our country and our people.”  “I would encourage everyone to show members of our armed forces  both past and present the respect they deserve and give them a pat on the back or a word of thanks for the sacrifices they make on our behalf.”  “Our troops don’t get a lot for the very difficult and often dangerous work they do  and in my opinion don’t get the praise they truly deserve. From my own experience  I know that a simple “thank you” from a stranger can be worth more than a chest full of medals.”

UKIP Leader Nigel Farage:  We face one of the biggest threats to our way of life and our civilisation that we have ever seen.   When I make the argument we must get tough on border controls to ensure the safety of British citizens  I am told I’m not being compassionate. We must not let our compassion imperil our civilisation.   I believe we are making one of the greatest mistakes in our history. 
UKIP Leader Nigel Farage:  It is time to get tough and defend our borders properly. We must put in place a checking system at Dover for every car and lorry coming into the UK.   Share if you agree!
UKIP Defence Spokesman Mike Hookem MEP said:   It will take more than a length of wire fencing and some sniffer dogs to stop this crisis at Calais which shows no sign of abating. We need to check cars and lorries when they arrive in the UK and deport people who are not here legally.   But of course the main problem we currently have is our membership of the EU which stops us controlling our borders and puts the very safety of people in the UK at the mercy of other EU countries.   We know ISIL will be exploiting the chaos and it is unacceptable that Britain could be forced by EU rules to let in terrorists along with the flood of economic migrants if they ve been given EU passports by other member states.

Mike Hookem has said the Prime Minister should concentrate on protecting British people against terrorists rather than telling the BBC to refer to the terror group as Islamic State.  His comments come as Cameron said Muslims would  recoil  at the name used to  justify the perversion of a great religion.    The Prime Minister s focus should be on securing our borders from the terrorist threat - which won t be achieved by a bit of fencing - not worrying about who he may or may not upset when the atrocities committed by Islamic State are described in the media.

UKIP Leader Nigel Farage is right about the EU s failing migration policy  admits top Brussels diplomat Frans Timmermans  First Vice President of the European Commission.   If Timmermans think Nigel is often right  it begs the question  why does the EU continue to make one bad decision after another? The answer of course is because Timmermans  much like all the other paid up believers of the EU project  is only interested in furthering the EU s own interests  often at the cost of its half a billion citizens.
Nigel Farage:  I can’t remember how many European summits I’ve attended. They are generally pretty dull. Last week in Brussels  Mr. Cameron arrived to begin his grand renegotiation. He had previously set out the terms  saying that treaty change was necessary. This was a point that Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond followed up forcibly on the Andrew Marr program in early June. Sadly for the Prime Minister  his aim of treaty change has now fallen at the first hurdle.

UKIP Defence Spokesman Mike Hookem MEP has spoken out against using only airstrikes to defeat Islamic State in Syria  saying the strategy would be “totally ineffective in combating the extremist jihadist group”. The suggestion by the Conservatives of using fighter aircraft to bomb Syria is a “simplistic and predictable response to fix the failures of consecutive governments in tackling Islamic extremism.”  “We have been involved in airstrikes in Iraq  but the fact is IS have been making rapid progress across North Africa and securing bases in Libya. IS are exploiting the power vacuum created by the West’s  quick fix  intervention which brought about the death of Colonel Gadaffi.   “Libya is now not only a training ground for terrorists  including the perpetrator of the recent massacre in Tunisia  but the base for people trafficking of both civilians for financial purposes and smuggling IS fighters into Europe.

UKIP Leader Nigel Farage has today written for The Telegraph on the result of the Greek referendum and what it means for the EU:   Whatever fine aims there were fifty or sixty years ago have no relevance to the reality of life for young people right across the EU now  including in Greece. The EU’s old  outdated ideas have been rejected at the ballot box in exchange for a new approach and fresh thinking.

UKIP MP Douglas Carswell:  Grexit looms. So  too  does Brexit. Sometime next year there is almost certain to be a referendum on Britain s membership of the EU.   Like the Greeks  we  too  will find the EU elite  and their local satraps  trying to frighten us into voting for more Brussels. Already lobbyists with a stake in the Brussels system are pouring money into a nascent In campaign.   Unlike Greece  Britain – mercifully - never joined the euro. We have our own currency. Our economy grows  exports rise and trade with the wider world soars. If even bankrupt Greece can afford to reject more Europe  Britain cannot afford not to. 
UKIP Leader Nigel Farage:  I remember 7/7 ten years ago with great sadness. We should never forget about those killed  injured and affected by events of that day. 
UKIP Leader Nigel Farage:  Far from bringing peace  the EU now sows resentment.

Many of the themes in this budget are reflective of principles UKIP laid out in the party’s general election manifesto  the only fully costed and most praised policy document during the campaign. Yet without bold commitments to scrap EU contributions  the HS2 vanity project and significantly reducing foreign aid  this government simply is not restoring fiscal responsibility to the country at a rate that we find acceptable.  Deficit reduction is still too slow. The deficit will still be running at £70bn this year  a rate that is still far too high  and means we will not get into surplus until 2019 or 2020.  We strongly oppose scrapping the student maintenance grant and replacing it with a loan. Once again this shows a typical Tory adherence to the class system that simply fails to recognise why young people from low income backgrounds need financial support in order to compete.

Mike  who has been warning of Conservative attempts to fudge the defence spending figures for a number of months  said  “For all the Chancellor’s bravado in parliament today  his promises on defence have already proved absolutely worthless and nothing short of devious.

The BBC is subsidised under the threat of jail and uses it s subsidy to crowd out  in particular  independent  local news across the country through it s vast and increasing online presence. Nobody can compete on level terms with them  given  as they boast  that 97 per cent of the population access it s services at least once a week showing that it is a monopoly.   It is arguably not just a commercial monopoly but also an intellectual one as well with a monoglot view on issues such as immigration and Britain s relationship with the EU. With the impending EU referendum  the BBC must address its overall political bias so it does not use it s heft to unduly affect the result.

Unemployment is reduced not by health and safety regulations or expensive compliance rules but by people starting up and expanding businesses and taking on employees.   For that to happen they need to know they have flexible employment laws  open markets and solid economies with steady demand.   In contrast to this  the EU enforces rules making it expensive for SMEs to take on staff and environmental legislation that pushes up the costs of production.   As we start the campaign for Britain to leave the EU and regain its place on the world stage these statistics are vital for quashing the idea that we need political union for jobs.

Mr Hookem  a former soldier  said rather than saying UK troops will work with the U.S to tackle Islamic State   what we need is a world wide coalition  led by Arab nations  not the UK and U.S. once again acting as the world s self appointed policemen.

UKIP Leader Nigel Farage has blasted the desperate French president over calls for a SECOND European parliament to be created for members of the struggling Eurozone:     President Hollande  like so many of the Euro-Elite  has no imagination and no foresight. They look at error  and seeing it they wish  not to learn from it but to repeat it  and repeat it even more forcefully.   This is an increasingly desperate attempt to hold together the crumbling ethos behind the eurozone. 
Responding to the Prime Minister s speech on British identity and tackling Islamic extremism  UKIP s Peter Whittle said today:  As Culture Spokesman I have spoken frequently of how multiculturalism has separated people  discouraged integration and led to an alarming fragmentation in our society. It has also led to a situation in which effectively no questioning of other cultures  religions or traditions has been allowed.   We must also make it clear that immigration on the scale it has been happening is the enemy of true integration. It is simply practically impossible to integrate such numbers. And for those coming to our country  there is little incentive or need to integrate in a situation where there are effectively ready-made communities. A sense of separateness is then further entrenched.   While we remain in the EU  we cannot control our borders. We must once again take control of our own destiny; only then can there be any hope of building a more integrated society  one which is once again united.

The shocking story of a three year old child in Essex  removed from her grandparents by social services and put into foster care  highlights serious issues not only with social services but family law  according to Suzanne Evans UKIP Deputy Chairman.    It s heartless  cruel  devastating for the child and her grandparents  and casts shame on a Government that claims to promote the family.   All grandparents will read this story with a shiver of fear down their necks. If the worst happened and their own grandchildren found themselves without parents  would the state tear their grandchildren away from them?   This government pretends it believes in the fundamental building block of society  the family  yet oversees a system that deliberately pulls families apart. The secrecy of decision making in these cases  the fact that grandparents cannot get legal aid to state their case in court  and the presumption that social workers and the state know best make our current system one to be feared rather than applauded. Most sinister of all in this case is that the mother  a woman who was mentally ill  was encouraged to sign away her child  without there being any legal representation. Such a signature would not be acceptable in any other walk of life or law  so how can it be acceptable here?

UKIP has warned today of the threat of the EU  subverting  British education as Universities UK comes out against the UK leaving the European Union.  Deputy Leader Paul Nuttall MEP a former university lecturer  has also highlighted the role of Monnet Professors  academics selected and funded by the EU to promote EU integration. He argues that the payment of university teaching staff to promote EU ideals in European Universities amounts to the erosion of academic independence via a form of paid for propaganda.   To learn that one and a half thousand academics around the world are being paid by the EU to promote EU integration is deeply concerning and akin to the sort of deliberate indoctrination one would expect in Cold War Communism  not in the twenty first century western world.

UKIP s claims that the defence budget was bumped up to meet the NATO target of 2% of GDP on defence spending has been confirmed by respected think tank The Royal United Services Institute. Britain will meet the promise to spend only by adding the MI5  MI6 and GCHQ into the mix: without this money the percentage spending on defence would only be 1.85 per cent.  Defence Spokesman Mike Hookem said the findings showed there was  some unsure hand creative accounting going on in the Treasury which UKIP spotted on the day of the budget.    I said at the time this was an utter charade: for all the Chancellor s bravado in Parliament his promises on defence have already proved worthless.   We need to make sure our Armed Forces are properly funded  not treated like global policemen and not subject to secret cost cutting by a smoke and mirrors Chancellor. 
The crusade for Britain to quit the EU has received a massive boost after a shock poll revealed the full scale of voters  frustration with Brussels.

Unemployed migrants are being given thousands of pounds to find work in Britain under an EU scheme. It has emerged that the UK has taken a third of the young migrants involved in the “Your First EURES Job” programme.  Some 1 178 unemployed young people from the Continent have been found jobs  training or apprenticeships in Britain under the “jobs mobility” programme since it was set up in 2012.  That accounted for 34.7 per cent of the 3 387 jobs handed out so far  much higher than second place Germany  which has provided 659 placements. At the same time  just 25 Britons under 30 have found work under the scheme  less than 1 per cent of the total.  UKIP MEP Jane Collins  who uncovered the figures  said the scheme was a poor deal for Britain. “It is a slap in the face to the young people all over the UK who are looking for work and whose taxes have been spent making their chances of employment less likely.”
UKIP Deputy Leader Paul Nuttall MEP:  The Eurocracy may feel despised and harassed  but at least they have a hugely proportioned  taxpayer-fluffed feather bed in which to tend to their wounds   he said.   The poor people of Europe  such as the Greeks  who have to suffer the contempt of Brussels and the very real pain of EU policies have no such comfort. 
Communities up and down the UK face the problem of illegal traveller sites encroaching on public land. Councils have few powers to immediately deal with these sites. When they are moved on  it s local communities who are left with the bill to pay for clean up and removal of waste.  Making unauthorised traveller sites a criminal offence will swiftly deal with the problem of illegal sites. There will be a strong deterrent and powers for the police to clear illegal sites immediately. Rather than civil procedures  this will send a strong message that illegal sites are not tolerated.

UKIP Leader Nigel Farage:  Britain urgently needs a tough new approach on illegal migrants that sends a clear message: that those who seek to enter our country illegally and make Britain their home will not be allowed to. If we do not start sending that message  the problems we see in Calais aren’t going away any time soon. 
UKIP s Mike Hookem MEP was recently invited to Calais by a local haulage firm  in order to see for himself the gauntlet the drivers are forced to run each time they come through the port of Calais.  What Mike found amazed him and he made this video of his and the truckers experience.  Please share this video far and wide and demand the government take action to protect our hauliers  our business and our infrastructure.
UKIP Health Spokesman Louise Bours MEP:   If the Tories don’t stop this going on  it will show once and for all that they prioritise the EU more than they care about the NHS and the health of British people.   It is of course outrageous that this has been allowed to take place  but Cameron’s claim that the government didn’t know it was going on is equally unacceptable.   It’s the job of the UK government to know where and how tax payers’ money is being spent  and they either did know about this crazy anomaly or they should have. 
Move over Dennis the Menace: Brussels has produced a series of sinister propaganda cartoons promoting the EU. UKIP MP Douglas Carswell says the comic books are like something produced by communist dictatorships in the 1980s.   This is propaganda. On one level it s hilarious. It shows a total lack of self-awareness. It s comically ridiculous. But there s also something that is a little bit sinister. It s something that the East German regime might have done in the 1980s  or any number of unsavoury dictatorships trying to promote their legitimacy with the young.   It s actually quite sad. Europe used to lead the world. It s now led by clowns. It s part tragedy  part farce. 
Despite election promises to crack down on migrant benefits  the Government is having to admit it can only do so by applying the same rules to UK citizens.  Suzanne Evans UKIP s Deputy Chairman said   If this is the focus of Mr Cameron s negotiation strategy it appears that the white flag is being run up  before his ship has left the port. It is a simple fact of our membership of the EU that we cannot prioritise our own citizens in the benefit system.    UKIP pointed this out when the Prime Minister made these promises in November. Anybody with a cursory understanding of EU law would know that. It rather asks questions about the honesty of the Government s election strategy 
UKIP has today completed a mini reshuffle  with Mark Reckless being confirmed as the Party s Economic Spokesman.  The former MP was a City Economist  and his past publications include  The Euro: Bad for Business    The Drivers of Regulation  and Euromoney  Guide to the London financial markets .  Mr Reckless said   I am delighted to take up the economics role for the party. It is an exciting time with the European referendum now firmly on the horizon. One of the most important roles in that campaign will be to show to the British public the economic opportunities and advantages for British business and the wider economy when we leave the European Union.

60% of Britons say the EU has handled the migration crisis badly. Do you agree? Isn t it about time we controlled our own borders?
Only 14% of Britons want further integration with the EU.  Hit share to spread the word.
UKIP MEP Mike Hookem slams the government s inability to control the migration crisis.  He said:  After spending many hours in Dunkirk police station reporting the events of Monday  where my staff and I were threatened with a handgun  the National Police told us there was nothing they could do unless they had proof the cars were involved in smuggling  and often they didn t have the ability  even if they did manage to bug suspect cars  to translate what the men were saying within the 48 hour time period the law allows.  It means it is up to the British authorities to take action  checking cars when they enter the UK and not just waving through these smart Passats and Jaguars because they have British number plates.   The severity of the situation is hidden from the majority of the British public. After days spent with lorry drivers  French police and residents of these areas I know they are being threatened and intimidated. Crime is up  people do not dare to enter areas the smugglers control and at night Calais and other towns report migrants threatening residents and businesses.    We ve the EU to thank for this mess we are in and a government who have simply refused to step up to their obligations to protect the British people. Far from having ‘a grip’ on the problem  this lacklustre response by the government to deport illegal immigrants  clamp down on these suspected British people traffickers and to tell the EU that we will not be taking part in rescue missions in the Mediterranean only maintains the problem.

UKIP Leader Nigel Faragel has today slammed David Cameron s renegotiation as a con job.  Mr Farage said:  It is clear that Cameron s so-called renegotiation is a complete con job. Only the other day  the government were saying that Treaty change would be required but we now know that is no longer on the table either.    Whether its border controls or the supremacy of the British Parliament  the big important issues of the day are simply not even up for discussion which is why Britain must vote  No  and leave the European Union. 
The Union flag is about unity says UKIP Culture Spokesman Peter Whittle.  Top athletes Greg Rutherford and Dame Kelly Holmes have expressed their disappointment at the disappearance of the Union flag from the British kit for the upcoming World Championships in Bejiing.  And with depressing predictability The Guardian has run an article in which it brands the flag  ugly and divisive.   The author of the piece  Joanthan Jones  is the same critic who poured scorn over the immensely popular World War I poppies installation at the Tower of London last year...
Low inflation is no excuse to postpone rise in interest rates says UKIP Economy Spokesman  Mark Reckless.  UKIP Economy Spokesman  Mark Reckless  this morning welcomed the continued low level of Consumer Price Inflation (CPI) with prices on that measure up 0.1% on the year to July 2015.  However  Mark expressed concern at policy makers dragging their feet on returning interest rates to more normal levels.  Prices tend to fall in July with the summer sales  but this year the fall in the CPI index from 128.2 to 128.0 was less than the fall from 128.3 to 127.8 between June and July last year. We are also benefitting temporarily from falling petrol and diesel prices lowering the inflation rate by 0.7%.
The Cardiff Bay establishment are out of touch with voters  UKIP Economics Spokesman Mark Reckless says.   There seems to be a distance from what I describe as the Cardiff Bay establishment and just people I speak to on the doorstep in Wales   said Mr Reckless.   They re out of touch with voters. And I think part of that is the Cardiff Bay establishment sees devolution as something that s about them and about their powers and their importance.   Mr Reckless said UKIP accepted devolution and wanted to  make it work   but rejected the idea of Welsh powers over income tax without public approval in a referendum.   We don t want to see taxes raised and I don t think there s any burning desire from people in Wales to be paying yet more tax than people in England   he said.   I don t understand why there s such a consensus in the Cardiff Bay establishment that that s the way to go  having promised that that wouldn t happen back in 2011   he added  referring to the last devolution referendum in Wales.  ---  Living in Wales?

UKIP defence spokesman Mike Hookem MEP has called for Afghan interpreters who worked with the British Army to be given priority to apply for asylum  saying they  should not be left to suffer at the hands of Islamic extremists”.  Mr Hookem said there were  legal channels for those people who are in danger because of their work with British forces to get to a safe country and apply to live in the UK.”  “At the very least  we should be extending the same rights to former Afghan interpreters as those already in place for their Iraqi colleagues. Surely the UK can also demand that other EU countries honour a fast track system for those who greatly aided NATO forces in a time of conflict.”  Read more:  http://www.ukip.org/ukip_s_mike_hookem_mep_afghan_interpreters_must_get_fast_track_uk_entry
UKIP calls for NATO Action to Stem Migrant Flow  Responding to today’s ‘Gold Command’ declaration on the Calais migrant crisis by the French and British governments  UKIP’s Migration spokesman Steven Woolfe commented:  “Throughout this crisis the response of both governments has been lamentable and knee jerk. This latest declaration is yet another of example of this. Over the summer lorry drivers and passengers suffered the consequences of the British and French government’s inability to develop cohesive long term solutions.  The UK government has finally woken up to the logistics and security threat that migrant flash mobs in the Port pose to a major transport artery to and from Britain. The French Authorities  as usual don t care about the British problem  are prioritising receiving EU money for rebuilding Calais port over the migrant camps. Neither government has the political will  ideas or care to address the cause of the problem in this declaration which is the extraordinary flow of illegal migrants into Europe. 
Nigel Farage in today s Telegraph:  When the referendum comes  the British people will finally have their chance to reject these open borders by saying No to the European Union.   Hit Like if you ll be saying NO to the EU!
Read UKIP Leader Nigel Farage s latest article in the Telegraph about how immigration will be the defining issue of this EU referendum campaign.
UKIP s Steven Woolfe MEP:  This must be the week that the net migration numbers come out since this announcement has to be one of the most stupid ideas yet from a Government utterly bereft of a clue on how to deal with the migration crisis. It’s an idea dreamed up the Conservative Party’s PR department to camouflage Thursday’s ONS immigration statistics which will show that yet gain the government has lost control of Britain’s borders.  “Sending illegally working immigrants to gaol will cost a fortune  put huge pressure on the prison system  add treacle to the already gummed up courts system with the possibility of remand and appeals stretching into a Human Rights Act horizon and keep the immigrants on our shores. Instead the Government should deport them. If they are illegally working they have broken the law. It’s that simple. 
Illegal migrants  instead of being deported are to be jailed in British prisons at the expense of the British taxpayer.  Share if you think it is an outrage.
Reports that small businesses are closing due to the new EU digital VAT rules - the VAT MOSS plan - introduced at the turn of the year have been met with dismay by UKIP s Small Business Spokesman Margot Parker:  This was our fear all along - just a few months down the line  small businesses are being seriously harmed.   We are hearing of closures and hardship - exactly as we predicted and feared and exactly why UKIP was opposed to this legislation. Yet again  it is an ill-thought out idea which adds to the red tape the EU seems to love being wrapped up in.   The European Union is no friend to the small businessman. Share if you agree.
In yet another blow to Wales  Tata Steel has announced mothballing its plant in Llanwern  signalling the loss of 250 jobs. This comes just a year after the steel giant announced closing its site in Port Talbot  costing 400 jobs. Last month Tata closed two sites in Yorkshire blaming ‘crippling high electricity costs’  UKIP Policy Chief Mark Reckless says: “Announcements like these spell disaster for hundreds of people whose jobs rely on a thriving industrial sector. With hopeless energy policy driving up operational costs to unmanageable levels  massive companies like Tata are closing plants in Wales in favour of cheaper sites elsewhere. The real impact on the Welsh economy must not be underestimated.  “Currently we take directions from the European Union on ridiculous targets that render our economy deeply uncompetitive. It’s all very well MPs in Westminster and AMs in Cardiff Bay decrying this latest closure  but until they admit that unless we wrest back control of energy policy from the EU and pursue an effective  business friendly agenda rather than pie-in-the-sky green legislation  this sort of story will become all too common. 
Many British jobs across our United Kingdom are at risk of being lost thanks to disastrous EU regulations in the shape of high energy costs.

Responding to the latest record net migration figures which are their highest ever level  UKIP Leader Nigel Farage said:  These figures reflect Borderless Britain and the total impotence of the British government.    If open borders are not part of the Cameron renegotiation then what s the point of it?   Given 192 000 from Romania and Bulgaria registered for National Insurance in the year period  how can we believe the ONS figure of 53 000 from the same two countries in the same year? 
UK Independence Party (UKIP) added a new photo to the album: Timeline Photos.
Government figures on immigration are all over the place. For the year to March 2015  the Office for National Statistics reported that there were 53 000 new Romanian and Bulgarian immigrants – “a statistically significant increase and almost double the 28 000 in the previous 12 months”.  The question is – why are the National Insurance numbers (NINos) so different  at a total of 214 000 registrations of Romanians and Bulgarians (EU2) to the year ending June 2015.

As Nigel Farage says last time UKIP campaigned on the issue of EU membership  we won coming first in the European Elections 2014.  Will you stand with Nigel and us in the forthcoming EU Referendum Campaign?
UKIP s Head of Policy Development Mark Reckless has today welcomed the Government rethink on the application of ‘purdah’ during the EU Referendum Campaign.   It is important that neither those in Governmental nor in the civil service exploit their office in order to promote one side of the argument or the other. The Government is duty bound to give absolute clarity as to what the ‘exceptions’ to Purdah are.   We would also call for the Government to make it clear to the European Union institutions that they too should refrain from announcing new policy objectives and spending promises in the UK during the period of the campaign and also honour British purdah rules.   This is the first time in over forty years that UK citizens will be granted a say on our ongoing relationship with the European Union. It is vital that the campaign is not just seen to be fair  but is in fact and in all ways  fair. 
Last night in Peterborough saw the first of nine EU Referendum Debates across the East of England which was won by UKIP with a team consisting of Patrick O Flynn MEP and UKIP Deputy Chairman Suzanne Evans.  A ballot was taken before the debate and one at the end to see the outcome. People were asked:  Should the United Kingdom remain a member of the European Union?  Results of the post debate ballot were as follows: YES 11%  NO 88%  SPOILT BALLOT 1%.  Suzanne Evans UKIP Deputy Chairman said:  The fast-paced debate format worked brilliantly; we covered a lot of ground and I think that helped sway the  don t knows  to our side. The fact is that when you start to drill down into the detail of how the EU operates it s nigh on impossible not to see how utterly unnecessary it is to Britain s success. We also managed to blow apart some of the  in  sides sound bites which don t stand up to scrutiny. 
UKIP s Jonathan Arnott MEP said  We welcome today s categorical confirmation that Nissan is here to stay in the UK  as we knew all along. We have guarantees of a free trade deal if we were to leave the EU  and World Trade Organisation rules would prevent the kind of punitive tariffs Labour are warning about.   Labour s claims have been utterly shattered  and this news is a huge blow for them. In ten separate articles on their website  local Labour MEPs claim that we must stay in the EU to prevent firms like Nissan leaving the UK.  “Labour gold-plated Nissan s actual words to seek votes  and now their scaremongering has come back to bite them. It s a low blow to threaten people with unemployment if they don t support the European Union  and today s announcements will set many minds at rest. There s a key question of trust here; Labour needs to stop putting words into the mouth of big business and using them as a political football.

UKIP Leader Nigel Farage will be kicking off the #SayNoEUTour in Margate tonight where he will say that the impact of immigration on places like Kent will be a key focus for the campaign to leave the EU.  “The coast of Kent represents the frontline of Britain and has seen more when it comes to the recent migrant crisis than any other part of the country. From miles of queues backed up under Operation Stack to the increase in illegal entrants coming into the UK via Kent  we know more than most about the impact of Europe’s open borders.”  “The issue of immigration is more pertinent than ever  with concerns that transcend the still vital arguments of overcrowding and unsustainable pressures on jobs  schools  hospitals and housing.”  Find out more about the #SayNoEUTour here: http://www.saynotoeu.com/

The migrant crisis has made people really concerned about what is going on  whether we should be part of a European Union which has embarked on a disastrous policy failure.”

Nigel Farage writing for today s Belfast Telegraph:  Properly operated  devolution should bring major benefits to Northern Ireland  but UKIP wants to see a fully functioning  responsive  effective and efficient government in Northern Ireland. As a new kind of party  UKIP listens to voters and reflects their real  deeply-seated concerns  which in Northern Ireland include the impact uncontrolled immigration is having on their children s life chances and job opportunities  on their own access to GPs and the health service.   UKIP offers Northern Ireland voters a new kind of unionism  bringing Northern Ireland into the mainstream of modern British life while giving people local solutions to problems. We are here to stay here in Northern Ireland.

UKIP Defence spokesman Mike Hookem MEP has called for Jeremy Corbyn to “confirm his commitment to the Falkland Islanders” following his election to the leadership of the Labour Party.  The MEP and former Commando engineer was commenting after Argentina’s Ambassador to the UK claimed that Mr Corbyn was “one of us” and his election was “without doubt” a “change of winds” in the UK over sovereignty of the Islands.  “In March 2013 the Falkland Islands held a referendum where 99.8 per cent of people voted to remain under British rule ” Mr Hookem said.  “In light of previous comments made over the future of the Islands by the new Leader of the Opposition I think it is only right that he sets out his stance - and that of Labour - over the support which the UK will give to the Falkland Islanders. 
UKIP Deputy Leader Paul Nuttall MEP:  The best way for Corbyn to keep hold of his position as leader and maintain his dignity is to show a bit of backbone he used to have by taking the fight to the enemy of the poor – the EU. Corbyn went to a good school  he’s a bright bloke  and he will know that open-door immigration from the EU is pushing down wages for unskilled British workers.   There are hundreds of examples he could quote where our membership of the EU is bad for working people  if only he’d have the bravery to say now what he was saying before he was elected leader.   I guess it depends on whether he values the opinion of the 31 men and women in the shadow cabinet more than the 38 million working age people in the UK  who seem to be coming round to the Eurosceptic way of thinking.   So come on Jeremy  find your missing backbone  stand up to the Labour Westminster set  say no to the vested interests and straight talk like you used to about the EU. You know deep down you want to. 
UKIP taking the lead to get the UK out of the EU. We will be holding hundreds of public meetings across the country #SayNoEUTour

UKIP Leader Nigel Farage for Breitbart London:  It is a paradox with the modern EU that the more each of its grand designs such as the Euro and the current migrant crisis fail  the greater is the ability of Brussels to gain more powers and more centralisation.    In nearly every case  from Tsipras’ election victory in Greece to the current crisis  nothing stops the juggernaut. Every objection is overruled. The European Council meets again next week. One day  this whole thing will blow apart though I suspect not just yet. For now  Mr. Juncker can enjoy his fine lunches.   LIKE if you agree with Nigel.
UKIP Business spokesman Christopher Mills: “It is typical of the inveterate Eurocrat that Mr Juncker is that he will try and avoid difficult questions about his own conduct by trying to force through greater European integration. To people like him  there isn t a problem there isn t a crisis  there isn t a question to which the answer is not “More European Union”.   Harmonisation of tax regimes will only have the impact of making European Countries less competitive in the global market and drive business our of the European Union  and therefore out of the UK into the wider world. Harmonisation has failed  is failing and will continue to fail in almost every area it has been tried  and to try to impose it on corporation tax will just be another example.   Why should British business suffer reduced competitiveness  and the UK Government be hamstrung in the Global market in order to spare the legal blushes of a posturing Eurocrat?”
UKIP Wales Leader Nathan Gill MEP: “For decades we have had a one party state under Labour in Wales  and have seen standards repeatedly decline in health  education and employment. There are so many voters out there who are switching to UKIP as the only party that really understands and represents them.  “In Wales people are crying out for a voice of opposition in the Welsh Assembly who will take Labour to task over pitiful policy making. They want decent housing  employment  a good education for their children and a sense of being heard and represented. Instead they see out of touch politicians in the Assembly who are totally disconnected from their world.  “Finally next year that will come to an end  with UKIP representatives in the Assembly.  This is not just an exciting time for UKIP. This is an exciting time for Wales and I expect UKIP to be the major story of next year’s assembly election campaign. 
Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn s campaign for the renationalisation of UK railways is derailed before it even gets out of the station  according to UKIP Transport spokesman Jill Seymour MEP.   As long as we remain members of the European Union  Britain is simply not allowed to do this   says the West Midlands MEP  who sits on the Transport committee in Brussels.  Ever since the first Railways Directive back in 1998  the EU has dictated that all member states must provide competition and allow independent companies to apply for non-discriminatory track access.   Mr Corbyn has only been in position for a week  but it is already clear that his policy ideas are off the rails. I suggest he should check his facts before making such sweeping statements - unless  of course  he is proposing to join UKIP in campaigning for a  no  vote in the upcoming European Union referendum?

The European Parliament is planning a major refurbishment that could potentially cost millions to improve the comfort of MEPs and give them more space. Officials claim extensive work is needed on their main building in Brussels as it is in a state of ‘dilapidation’ despite it being only 22 years old. They also say it needs to be much bigger in size so that the 751 MEPs have got more offices to accommodate their growing numbers of staff.  UKIP Deputy Leader Paul Nuttall MEP said in response: ‘A.E. Housman s quip that “The house of delusions is cheap to build but drafty to live in” isn’t quite correct.   The European Parliament was expensive to build and extortionate to renovate. You can put lipstick on a pig  but it s still a pig. 
Responding to Ruth Davidson  Leader of the Scottish Conservatives saying that she will support the UK remaining in the EU  come what may - David Coburn MEP  Leader of UKIP Scotland said:  Scots opposed to the EU should vote for UKIP in the May Scottish Parliamentary elections regardless of party. All the other parties support rule from Brussels  including the Tories  to a greater or lesser extent.   Currently 80% of decisions are being made in Brussels and Frankfurt and not Holyrood and Westminster. UKIP is the ONLY party giving real independence to Scotland by bringing powers back to Holyrood and Westminster from the undemocratic remote European Union.   By stating that she will support the UK remaining in the EU  come what may  Ruth Davidson is abandoning those 35% of Scots  according to the latest polls who are already committed to supporting an  Leave  vote in the upcoming referendum. Today  the only Scottish party that represents those people  is UKIP. 
Responding to the ministerial agreement on mandatory quotas  UKIP MEP Jane Collins said  there is now no escaping the fact that immigration will be decided by Brussels. What we have witnessed today is four countries who wish to control who settles in their country being outvoted by foreign governments. Brussels have taken another giant step into territory which should be the sole right of national governments to decide upon.   In the UK we know that politicians are out of sync with what the public want to happen about the migrant crisis and EU leaders are no different. The EU already have their Common Asylum and Immigration policy ready to go for next year and as we head into this referendum campaign we should keep this in the forefront of our mind in deciding whether we want to control who comes to live in our own country.   The best policy would be to help genuine refugees in the camps in Lebanon  Jordan and Turkey  ending the demand for the people traffickers and stopping deaths at sea. 
UKIP Deputy Leader Paul Nuttall MEP:  Nobody who has eyes to see can be surprised by these figures from the OECD. Of course  there has been a huge hike in immigration. The evidence is all around us in increased house prices  longer waiting lists and overcrowded primary schools.  “We need to take control of our immigration system and introduce a points based system  ensuring fairness  both for immigrants and for the people of this country. The only way to do that is to leave the EU.”
Speaking at the edges of the European Council Summit this afternoon in Brussels  UKIP MEP Jane Collins said:  EU ministers have chosen the nuclear option by ramming mandatory quotas upon national governments of the East against their will. This will cause deep resentment in these states and make the EU even more unpopular.   The UK is financial liable for part of this project but has no say. Regarding the migrant crisis  it s all pay and no say. For economic  security  cultural and democratic reasons UKIP are opposed to this system of mandatory quotas.  
UKIP Northern Ireland is delighted to announce that Antrim Councillor Donna Anderson has left the Traditional Unionist Voice  TUV and joined UKIP.  Cllr Anderson joins a growing band of UKIP councillors in Northern Ireland and builds on UKIP’s success in the recent general Election. She was welcomed into the fold today at Stormont by the UKIP Party Leader in Northern Ireland  David McNarry MLA.  David McNarry said:  I am delighted to welcome Councillor Donna Anderson to UKIP serving Mid & East Antrim Borough Council. Donna is committed and dedicated to her community and her country. A real people person who will fit well into the united UKIP team which is growing its connection with people across Northern Ireland.   This means that with Councillor Donna Anderson and Councillor Noel Jordan UKIP have a double impact on Mid and East Antrim Council.

UKIP Leader Nigel Farage: Thanks to the crusade of the Daily Express and UKIP over many years an EU referendum is happening. After making the arguments as to why the UK must leave the EU to get our democracy back we now have the opportunity to do just that.  The prospect of an independent Britain outside the EU that can control its own borders  make its own laws and stop handing Brussels £55million per day is a reality. Now we just need to win the referendum.  If we are to win this fight  those who want to get the UK out of the EU must come together to beat the odds that are stacked against us by the establishment. That is why I am so proud that the UKIP conference will help act as an arena for a united leave the EU side ready to get Britain out.  This referendum is a truly defining moment and one which we  can  by working together  get our democracy and our borders back. All of us who want to see the UK leave the EU must come together  unite and win this referendum for the sake of our country.
Our annual conference has now begun  where we will be showing how we can be better off out of the EU.  If you have not managed to make it  you can watch Nigel’s speech at 12:00 and the Friday afternoon session on our livestream at: www.ukip.org/live

UKIP is to reverse its policy on the abolition of inheritance tax in order to address a more urgent priority for the economy  public sector pay.  In his speech at the Party Conference in Doncaster yesterday Mark Reckless UKIP s Economics Spokesman announced that £5.2 billion of the Brexit dividend UKIP had earmarked to abolish inheritance tax would now be used to end the decade long near-freeze on public sector pay. UKIP would lift the 1% cap the Conservative Government is now imposing for a further four years following George Osborne’s budget.  UKIP s policy would mean that over five million teachers  nurses and other public sector workers in the UK  many of whom are taking home less pay than in 2010  would find themselves better off. UKIP believes that all of Britain  including hard working public servants  deserves a pay rise.

UKIP Leader Nigel Farage:   This push for a Dutch referendum shows that many peoples across Europe  not just the British  are tired of the EU forcing laws  expenses and migrants onto them without their consent. This is now the Dutch peoples’ chance to show the Brussel’s bureaucrats that national democracy cannot be ignored forever.   I am delighted for it looks like that the Netherlands will have a referendum on an EU issue. Going by their last vote it should be a big No to the EU’s expansionist plans.  Congratulations to the dedicated democratic citizens who organised this brave initiative.“
UKIP MEPs have unite in condemnation of the closure of the Redcar steel works. Jonathan Arnott MEP said:  This is a tremendously sad day for Redcar  the North East and the United Kingdom. Thousands of jobs will now be lost directly at SSI  and thousands more indirectly. Redcar will be hit particularly hard as it is already has high levels of unemployment. Our proud British manufacturing tradition deserves better than this  and the real tragedy is that it is so unnecessary: the industry will be viable in the long term.  Roger Helmer  UKIP s Energy spokesman said  ”These workers are being sacrificed to climate alarmism and Brussels Bureaucrats. The Government sets fanciful targets for restoring manufacturing in Britain while our energy policies create an industrial massacre (as Antonio Tajani  the then European Commissioner for Industry has pointed out).”  UKIP Employment spokesman Jane Collins MEP: British jobs are being lost because our membership of the EU makes doing business in the UK  particularly manufacturing  uncompetitive.

UKIP s Mike Hookem MEP: “I have no doubt that the people arrested by French police are part of the same criminal gang who threatened me and my team with a gun in August. As I said at the time  the trafficking has spread out from Calais to other ports - how much fencing can we pay for in an effort to close down this vile trade?  “We should protect the security of our own country by taking back control of our borders from Brussels and checking all vehicles that come into the UK. We need to send a crystal clear message: arrive here illegally and you will be sent back. Anything else just provides business for gangs.”

Latest figures from the Ipsos/Mori issues index have shown that 40% now regard immigration as the biggest single issue facing the UK  with 56% regarding it as one of the most important. Even 49% of Labour supporters rate it as the highest concern.  UKIP Immigration Spokesman Steven Woolfe MEP said  “This poll number reflects badly on those amongst our country’s leaders who do not see how mass uncontrolled immigration is damaging the fabric of our nation. The people of this country do because they have the common sense to see that mass migration changes nations. If a country loses too many of its talented  economically aspirational people like those on the periphery of the Eurozone it is destined for economic failure. But if a country attracts millions of foreign born residents at an unplanned  accelerated rate it s infrastructure and public services are bound to creak at the seams.

A MUST READ FROM Breitbart London: Yes  there IS EU Propaganda in schools  and it’s worse than you think   Let us know in the comments what pro EU materials you or your children have come across...
The National Trust has discovered that in two thirds of areas of Outstanding Natural Beauty planning schemes were given the nod ahead of concerns for the environment.  Responding to this Andrew Charalambous  UKIP Housing & Environment Spokesman said:  The National Planning Policy Framework (NPPF) is potentially the biggest ever threat to the British environment from a government that once aspired to be Britain s greenest ever. The government must take immediate steps to enshrine the protection of our countryside in law. This will necessitate the undoing of the NPPF which will make our country unrecognisable within a decade. No government has the right to deprive future generations of the great spectacle of the British countryside. 
In response to the news that SSI UK has gone into liquidation Jonathan Arnott MEP  Redcar’s local UKIP Euro-MP  said:  The SSI plant in Redcar has been an integral part of the local community for many  many years. Not only will these 1 700 jobs now be lost with all the uncertainty that redundancy creates  there will be a secondary impact on many other local companies associated with the steel industry. Redcar already has a high level of unemployment  so the impact upon the local community cannot be overestimated. I am deeply disappointed that our government did not fight harder to keep SSI open - and in the part played by EU state aid rules and British energy policy.   UKIP employment spokeswoman Jane Collins MEP said:  Another week  another company that has gone under and more jobs lost. This goes to show that being ruled by the EU and their  green  policies not only destroys businesses but destroys people s lives in this country by taking away their livelihood. The impact of our EU membership stretches far and wide and with Labour determined to pretend that it s beneficial for us to be members means that UKIP will continue to be the real opposition in the North of England. 
UKIP Leader Nigel Farage:  Only in a tyrannical country would the state seek to exert control over the type of content that universities speak about. Indeed Stalin was very good at it. What I have discovered is that deep political prejudice lies at the heart of our universities and that the EU has effectively tried to buy the sector.   I’m only at the start of my campaign to understand the depths to which our universities have sunk and their attempt to influence young minds in our country. But I do feel a campaign coming on. A campaign  once all of the facts have been assembled  where we can urge Britain’s students to rebel against this indoctrination. To help me in this I want anybody who has been subjected to pro-EU  anti-UKIP urging throughout their university or school life to contact us with their stories.   It is time we took on this indoctrination once and for all in the run up to the EU referendum. 
As our friends over at Leave.EU explain  with exports growing to the rest of the world we can be better off without the EU.
UKIP Housing Spokesman Andrew Charalambous:  UKIP are the only party with something fundamentally different to say when it comes to housing. We are the only party straight talking enough to address the demand side of the housing equation. Rather than pursuing constantly upward shifting supply targets we believe it is necessary to tackle the accelerating demand for affordable and social housing. Our starting point remains our membership of the EU which has become the gateway to four million immigrants arriving in the UK over the past decade.#   A British exit from the EU would give us back control of our borders enabling us to effectively plan for future housing needs.

David McNarry MLA  UKIP Leader in Northern Ireland  has condemned suggestions by the Taxpayer’s Alliance at a fringe meeting in the Tory Party conference to cut pensioner’s benefits:    To suggest that the government should exploit the current disarray of the Labour Party to make savage cuts to pensioner benefits and then make the suggestion that pensioners would ‘forget’ who had cut their benefits by the time of the next election  is deeply offensive to millions of people in this country. It is the language of condescension and contempt and it should have no part in political debate.  “The attitude portrayed by these comments shows a deep seated contempt for voters  and it shows what is wrong with so many of today’s political parties  whose only interest in voters is to use and exploit them. UKIP  unlike the other parties  puts people at the centre  delivers on its promises and voices the concerns ordinary people have. UKIP will always stand up for pensioner’s rights.”
Governments use the European Union to bypass national democracy and pass laws that national parliaments would not accept  a Home Office minister has admitted today at the Conservative Party Conference.  UKIP MEP Gerard Batten said the practice of bypassing national parliaments described by the minister amounted to ignoring the public: “This is hard evidence that this Government uses the EU to undermine national democracy. It also shows why it is that the establishment elite so loves the European Union. It means that they can ignore the public  and do whatever it is they want.”
Steven Woolfe MEP responds to the Home Secretary Theresa May s speech on migration today:  The Conservative Party s message about the need for controlled immigration at their conference is almost laughable. While both The Prime Minister and Theresa May echo UKIP almost verbatim in their rhetoric  it is important to bear in mind that this is the second term under the Conservatives  with May as Home Secretary and Cameron as leader and their government has broken all previous records on net migration and asylum into the UK.    Until the government grasp the nettle and opts Britain out of free movement or leaves the EU entirely  it can only talk about controlling our borders not actually do it. Similarly just sounding like UKIP doesn t mean that they have the well thought through fair and ethical migration policies that our party won so much support for at the last general election. Mrs May s speech would have been much more coherent if she had made a call for BREXIT.

WATCH: Nigel Farage s latest speech from the European Parliament.   We re living in a German-dominated Europe of Disharmony 
Labour and Liberal Democrat councillors in Calderdale have teamed up to ban their local authority from flying the Union flag at local schools  calling the proposal “nasty” and “nationalistic”. They also blocked moves to implement a policy of school assemblies singing the national anthem  calling it “inappropriate” and that the plan would “promote nasty  nationalistic tendencies”.  UKIP MEP Jane Collins said the councillors “should be ashamed of themselves. They’re quite happy to take their expenses off the British tax payer yet insult the country by saying that children should not sing the national anthem and that the Union Flag is “nasty”.  “In fact it’s quite the contrary: it’s those councillors who don’t have pride in our country and who foster segregated societies who are the nasty ones. Labour have clearly learned nothing from the outrage their leader caused by not singing the National Anthem at the Battle of Britain memorial.”
In a debate in the European Parliament yesterday UKIP leader Nigel Farage provoked French President Hollande to admit that Brexit was a logical choice. In his speech the UKIP Leader said that we are living in a German dominated Europe which is causing resentment and division. After badly mishandling the migrant crisis  Europe was not an area of peace but of disharmony.  However  there is a bright star on the horizon  it s called the British referendum and Brexit now looks more likely than at any point in modern time.  Do you agree that leaving the EU is logical?

The EU should stop wasting time trying to define what a woman is and do more to tackle more serious gender issues like female genital mutilation – says UKIP Health Spokesman Louise Bours MEP.  In a speech at the European Parliament  the MEP accused the commission of trying to force their view of what a woman is on the wider public and organisations within member states  by introducing boardroom gender quotas and sanctioning companies that don’t comply with their required gender balance.

A message from UKIP Leader Nigel Farage “I’ve given my support to Leave.EU which aims to engage the British public and has an amazing 200 000 registered supporters in its first seven weeks.  “Equally  I support the pro-business arguments that have been made by Vote Leave today. Arguments that UKIP have been making for over 20 years.  “But we have to get outside of Westminster to reach millions of people who don’t normally vote and for whom controlling our borders and having pride in our country are the biggest issues.  “I believe these campaigns are aiming at different audiences and are complementary not contradictory. Ultimately  I hope that we have one campaign that operates on a number of levels.”
Read Nigel Farage s latest column for Breitbart London on the trip of Hollande and Merkel to Strasbourg and his exclusive thoughts on the latest developments in the  Leave  the EU campaign.   The more people from across society who speak in favour of Britain taking back control of its own affairs the better.     However  to win this referendum we don’t just need to convince business. We have to reach out way beyond Westminster and in particular reach people who generally do not vote at all. For them  the arguments that most are likely to convince are about pride in our country and the total necessity to control our borders. 
UKIP Leader Nigel Farage:  The choice is clear: either we must accept more EU or we must leave. 
UKIP Deputy Leader Paul Nuttall MEP:  This week I stood up in the European Parliament in Strasbourg and spoke about an ‘inconvenient truth’. It was a speech that most in the chamber simply did not want to hear. To howls of derision  I told the European Parliament that what we have now on the continent is not a refugee crisis  as the media continues to tell us  but an economic migrant one.   In my opinion  we need to be honest about the problem we are facing and call it what it is. Now is not the time for politically correct language. The liberal Left  in their desire to please all of the people all of the time  are helping no one and solving nothing. These are issues that need addressing head on. 
UKIP Leader Nigel Farage:  The EU s irresponsible approach to the migrant crisis is causing chaos and is another example of why we must leave.

UKIP Leader Nigel Farage has responded to Lord Rose s speech at the launch of the  Remain  campaign:  Lord Rose deliberately confused Europe with the political union that is called the EU.   He argued that we are stronger in the world  have more influence and more clout. Has he forgotten that the United Kingdom no longer even has a seat on the World Trade Organisation and that Brussels now wants a single EU seat on the UN Security Council?   He argues that in order to trade we have to have free movement of people. Nowhere else in the world is that the case. To think that UK manufactured cars would face tariffs when we import hundreds of thousands more cars from Germany shows utter detachment from the realities of trade.   To argue that his is the patriotic position is turning the truth on its head. The EU has a star spangled banner. He s welcome to it. I prefer the Union Flag.

In a survey carried out by the Mori Institute for Urban Strategies London has been listed as the most powerful city in the world for the fourth successive year. The ranking is based on a combination of Economy  Research and Development  Cultural Interaction  Livability  Environment and Accessibility.  Peter Whittle  UKIP Mayoral Candidate for London said:  We all know it  and so  it appears does the rest of the world - London is simply the greatest city that there is. In the fields of the economy  culture and accessibility London leads the way. We still have some way to go  of course  and tackling the issues of housing and transport in London are UKIP s key aims and policy platforms for next year s elections.   It is clear that the pre-eminent position of London is broad based and is in no way predicated in the UK remaining part of the EU. We have nothing to fear from Brexit - and as a country and as a city we can look forward with great confidence for an even brighter future .

UKIP s Tim Aker MEP:  Yesterday I questioned Syed Kamall  Tory MEP Group Leader if he is supporting Britain leaving the EU. Despite telling the media  he would vote “no” if the referendum were held today  he is back to flip flopping on the issue. Yet again you can t trust the Tories on the EU! 
The government’s decision to allow a grammar school annexe to be built - in reality a new grammar school - is typical of their weasel-worded ways  said UKIP Deputy Leader Paul Nuttall MEP.  “Instead of having the courage to tear up the 1998 laws passed by Labour banning new grammar schools the Tories are allowing one by the back door.  “UKIP is 100% in favour of selective education and would introduce a grammar school in every town and city. That is our policy and we are proud of it. Such schools provide true social mobility and allow everyone regardless of background to get a first class education.  “The Tories  however  are too weak to implement a new policy despite the public demand  and Labour with its authoritarian outlook simply won’t believe that the public can disagree with one of their policies and be right.

UKIP Leader Nigel Farage:  We have learnt overnight that the accession process for Turkey to become a full member of the EU is to be speeded up.   Those who’re thinking about voting for Britain to remain a member of the European Union had better think very hard about how many more schools  hospitals and houses they think its acceptable for us to build ahead of Turkish entry.   The UK referendum campaign has taken a new twist today. From now on I intend to talk Turkey. 
UKIP’s Health Spokesman  Louise Bours MEP has said that the failing state of most of England’s hospitals proves that the oversight organisations are inept and should be abolished.  “For years it has been clear that the overseers of the NHS  the Care Quality Commission and Monitor are not up to the job. They don’t seem to spot potential problems before they happen  they just put reports together after it has all gone wrong. They need to be abolished and replaced with county health boards made up of local people.  “Doctors and nurses are under immense pressure  with resources being ploughed into administrators as opposed to front line  the money saved from abolishing the CQC and Monitor could be put to much better use.”

Appearing on the BBC comedy show  Have I Got News For You the Tooting MP and Labour s London Mayoral candidate  Sadiq Khan dismissed supporters of leaving the European Union as  xenophobes . Peter Whittle  UKIP Mayoral Candidate for London said   Writing off what may well be a majority of the population as xenophobes just shows how Khan isn t capable of leading our great city. He holds millions of Londoners in contempt.   Believing that Britain should be free and that London can and will thrive outside the European Union is a question of aspiration  and something that can engage all Londoners. It is not something that deserves the insults and incomprehension of people like Sadiq Khan. 
UKIP s Stuart Agnew MEP writes:  On Monday 12th October I was at a viewing of the recently published ‘Restricted’ Agricultural chapter of TTIP. I had to sign a document stating that I would not disclose what I would read and I had to hand over any electronic gadgets  cameras  etc. I was allowed a pen but no paper  and then led into a windowless cell where I was issued with special blank paper which cannot be photocopied.   If I publicly disclose what I have read  I will be subject to a minimum fine of £2233. I will also be at the mercy of Martin Schulz  President of the European Parliament  who dislikes UKIP and may impose further punishments. If the agricultural unions or media are willing to fully compensate me  then I may be tempted to break Parliament rules.   This is the EU s definition of transparency. They can truthfully say that the MEPs have now seen the document. The Agricultural chapter is one small part of a very ambitious trade negotiation where the British have to sit on their hands whilst an unelected foreign commissioner takes our decision for us.

Ahead of senior BBC executives  including Lord Hall  Director General and James Harding  Director of News and Current Affairs  appearing in front of the House of Commons European Scrutiny Committee UKIP Leader Nigel Farage has written an open letter to the BBC Trust and Ofcom to ensure that the debate surrounding the forthcoming EU referendum is framed accurately.  Too often in recent months it has become normal for many political correspondents from the BBC and elsewhere to use to use  Europe  as shorthand for  the European Union . Equally  it has been widely reported that those campaigning to remain in the European Union are deliberately replacing the name of the organisation with the term  Europe . To do so is inaccurate  given what Eurosceptics oppose is membership of a supranational political organisation  not fellow continental European nation states.  The EU Referendum debate is therefore not about whether Britain should remain in Europe  a geographic reality  but the European Union  a political construction. Furthermore  the Electoral Commission has suggested that the question be  Should the United Kingdom remain a member of the European Union or leave the European Union?’. As such  and as Nigel Farage s letter makes clear  reporting by the BBC and other broadcasters should reflect this deliberate selection of words.  Read the letter in full at the link below:

William Dartmouth MEP  UKIP’s International Trade Spokesman: I am calling for the introduction of emergency anti-dumping measures on Chinese steel. If the UK re-activated its full membership of the World Trade Organisation (WTO) with full voting and speaking rights  we could make our voices heard right away. Sadly  because we are members of the EU  we must go cap in hand to the European Commissioner on Trade  in a lengthy process necessitating the agreement of 27 other EU states  “Thousands of jobs have been lost in the last week at steel plants throughout the UK because of two main factors; the dumping of Chinese steel and a British steel industry rendered uncompetitive because of exorbitant energy prices  a consequence of the EU’s obsession with carbon emissions.   Our current membership of the EU is helping cripple our steel industry by pushing up energy prices and stopping us acting immediately at WTO level. This is just another reason to leave the EU’s political union.

UKIP Home Affairs Spokesman Diane James MEP:  Theresa May s turf battles with the police and specifically Sir Bernard Hogan-Howe are getting in the way of operational efficiency. This constant war of words is unhelpful  unnecessary and unwarranted.   Sir Bernard Hogan-Howe and his officers work at the  coal face  of the issues facing officers whilst Mrs May sits in her ivory Westminster tower. Yes there are issues with extending diversity representation across all UK police forces but this needs to happen in a measured and effective way not just so Mrs May can satisfy political correctness on meeting targets.   Instead of more mealy mouthed words and unpleasant and unnecessary attacks on our police forces  she should stop sapping morale further and fund the police men and women properly.

Watch Nigel Farage s speech in the European Parliament.  We re seeing the modern day implementation of the Brezhnev Doctrine: a country only has democratic rights if it s in favour of the EU project.
UKIP’s 2015 General Election Manifesto pledged to bring forward a full and open review of childcare and child protection services in Britain  with a view to initiating wholesale reform of a system that’s clearly failing. In particular  we singled out the need to investigate rising levels of ‘forced’ adoptions and the outrageous injustices that it entails. It’s this pledge that we’re fulfilling with the launch of Opening Up the Family Courts  the first paper to be published by the UKIP Parliamentary Resource Unit.  UKIP MP Douglas Carswell said “There is a scandal at the moment. Secrecy within the UK’s system of family courts is allowing social workers to ride roughshod over ordinary people and resulting in the unnecessary breakup of families and forced adoptions.  “We feel very strongly that the secrecy in the family courts is leading to some outrageous injustices. It’s the big cartel courts and the legal profession and the social workers riding roughshod against ordinary people. We think common sense is needed to address this that means greater sensitivity and more openness in the family courts which this timely paper advocates.”
Speaking in the European Parliament today  UKIP Leader Nigel Farage said that an increasingly authoritarian EU is crushing democratic rights and the UK s referendum on EU membership is a golden opportunity for those who wish to resuscitate democracy.   What we are seeing is an increasingly authoritarian European Union that crushes democratic rights and then actually crows about it  said Nigel Farage.  After Italy and Greece had their prime ministers deposed  we now have the dismissal of democracy in Portugal  where the President of Portugal  Mr Silva  is refusing elected Left-wing Eurosceptics office on the grounds that they represent anti-European forces. What we are witnessing  says Nigel Farage  is  the modern day implementation of the Brezhnev doctrine. This is exactly what happened to states living inside the USSR .
Retailers could struggle to keep their shelves stocked during the crucial Christmas trading period because of an alarming shortage of British lorry drivers  UKIP’s Transport spokesman Jill Seymour MEP has warned.  “I have been warning for months that we are lurching towards a massive crisis  and I take no satisfaction in saying that the evidence is now proving me right. The Road Haulage Association (RHA) believes the UK is now short of between 45 000 and 50 000 drivers  and says the situation is getting worse by the week. It’s alarming.  “It will be a tragedy  and a scandal  if the Government waits until shelves are left empty in the shops before realising they must raise this issue much higher up the political agenda.”
This weekend UKIP Leader Nigel Farage will be hosting his own late-night show on LBC from 10pm on Sunday night.

Today the European Parliament voted to reject agreed cuts to and instead increase the EU budget 2016 by 4 billion euro.  Jonathan Arnott MEP:  Europhile MEPs have gone for a bunker-busting budget  increasing spending commitments by 4 billion euro. This is a major defeat for Cameron who boasted of getting an agreement to cut the budget at the European Council in 2015. This has been shown to be a sham.   UKIP wanted to save the taxpayers  money and tabled 142 amendments to decrease the budget but of course EU-worshipping MEPs rejected them leaving ordinary people in national states with a bigger bill. The EU loves spending member state s money  the only way to stop them doing this is to leave the EU. 
UKIP Leader Nigel Farage for The Telegraph: This is what our nation has been reduced to: a grovelling junior member of a German-dominated club. Even by the Government’s own wildly unambitious measure  this renegotiation has been a national embarrassment.   Read the rest of his must read piece here: http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/politics/ukip/11961604/Britain-will-be-flattened-if-it-stays-in-the-EU.html
UKIP Deputy Leader Paul Nuttall MEP:  Does anybody honestly think the UK could cope with an extra 10 million residents within a generation?   Do we have the planning  housing  transport infrastructure or scope within the NHS  to manage with such an unprecedented and overwhelming rise in our population?   Quite clearly  we do not. 
UKIP Defence spokesman  Mike Hookem MEP has said that today s announcement that the Chilcot report will be published in either June or July next year as “a further extension of the misery felt by those demanding answers on the Iraq war.”  “The fact is the British people are now demanding a conclusion to this sad episode in our history and deserve the facts far quicker that the Chilcot report is delivering them. I would like to see Sir John Chilcot at least publish an overview of his findings sooner than the full text of the report.”  Sign and share the petition to release the Chilcot report so we can finally get the truth about the UK s involvement in the Iraq war.
UKIP Leader Nigel Farage:  The forecast of another 10 million growth in population over the next 25 years is huge and completely unsustainable. Our schools  roads  hospitals  housing and infrastructure are already reaching breaking point.    When it comes to housing alone  these numbers mean another 15 000 people per constituency will need somewhere to live on top of the massive house building required to keep up with current demand. Pressures on local services are already high and it looks as if the situation will only deteriorate.

It has today been revealed by UKIP Leader Nigel Farage that the US trade representative  who last week warned that the United States is not keen on pursuing a separate free trade deal with Britain if it leaves the European Union  failed to declare his interest in the subject before making his intervention in the ongoing EU Referendum debate.  Prior to his current role  the US trade representative  Michael Froman  worked for the European Commission President s own internal think tank  the “Forward Studies Unit”.  Mr Farage revealed this fact speaking to Breitbart News Daily Radio following an appearance on the BBC s Andrew Marr Show on Sunday.  Read the whole story at the link below  don t be fooled by outrageous interference in the EU Referendum debate...
Peter Whittle  UKIP Mayoral Candidate for London has used National Living Wage Week to highlight the amount of work that still needs to be done to ensure workers in the capital are getting a fair wage:  It s great that 724 businesses in London are now paying the living wage of £9.40 an hour  meaning that for their employees  they should at the very least have enough to get by living in London.   But before we listen to the likes of Boris Johnson and Sadiq Khan patting themselves on the back  let s put that into context. There are over a million businesses in London  while according to the Office of National Statistics  a quarter of jobs in London pay less than the living wage.   Research by London Poverty Profile puts the number of people in London living below the poverty line at 1.2 million  or 27% of the population. It s clear to see that we are not even close to ensuring a decent standard of living in London for almost a third of residents.

UKIP Leader Nigel Farage:  The question that I want to ask the people of Oldham West and Royton is a fundamental one. Does Jeremy Corbyn represent the interests of our national security and long-term viability of our country?   Mr. C has spent decades cosying up to the IRA. He wants to unilaterally abolish Trident  our nuclear defence system. He thinks the Falkland Islands should be surrendered to Argentina. He would like to abolish the British Army.

UKIP Employment Spokeswoman Jane Collins MEP has said the emergency steel meeting in Brussels today  whiffs of desperation as the government begs its masters to let it save the UK steel industry.    It is nauseating that a British minister has to plead its case with Eurocrats when the finger of blame for making the UK steel industry to uncompetitive hovered in the direction of Brussels.   Green levies pushing up energy prices have made our steel production more costly than in other countries which at a time of low prices thanks to a glut of Chinese steel is a death knell to the industry. And if course we have given up our seat on the WTO and signed up to EU control of the single market meaning we can t make a strong case or unilateral decisions on the status of China as a market economy.

Because of the move from EU prices to world prices. Now that is really worth having.”

The European Court of Justice has today dismissed British entrepreneur Sir James Dyson’s claim that new EU regulation on energy labelling of vacuum cleaners is discriminatory and unfair. Dyson’s vacuums  which use mainly “cyclonic” technology  are disproportionately penalised due to the flawed testing system which does not allow for fair comparison.  UKIP Small Business spokeswoman Margot Parker said  “I personally bought a Dyson last week but had I known this ECJ judgement was coming I would have bought two of them.   This judgement exposes the EU for the anti-competitive culture that it promotes. Bureaucrats hate entrepreneurs just as the EU detests democracy. Innovative British businesses are dicing with death when the EU gets them in a stranglehold.  “Unfortunately for Sir James Dyson he has found himself on the end of yet more anti-competitive  bureaucratic and ill-conceived European regulation.”
Fury as Dutch PM stands in for Cameron at EU meeting - just days after rubbishing Brexit.  UKIP Leader Nigel Farage commented   This is the greatest surrender of British sovereignty yet.

UKIP Trade Spokesman William Dartmouth MEP has commented today on the Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi s three-day visit to the UK saying: “The visit of India s Prime Minister is to be welcomed. But on trade  the UK s welcome is limited by the fact that  as an EU member the UK cannot enter into a Trade Agreement with India - or for that matter any other country.   UKIP Economics Spokesman Mark Reckless added:  The Prime Minister delegates UK interests at the EU led summit in Malta to the Dutch Prime Minister so he can instead discuss trade opportunities with the Indian Prime Minister. Does he not understand that we can have no trade policy while we are part of the EU as we have handed all our powers over trade to the EU Commission? .  Only by leaving the EU can we take back control  share to spread the word.

UKIP Leader Nigel Farage:  Being a member of the European Union is like being on a runaway train that is headed for the buffers. In the interests of our national security I do not want us to be on that train when it crashes.    No issue could highlight how badly led and utterly impossible the European project is more than the migrant crisis. This is the decisive issue that I now genuinely believe will lead to Britain voting to leave in our upcoming referendum on the matter.   Do you agree with Nigel?
UKIP Defence Spokesman  Mike Hookem MEP has welcomed news of a drone strike which is said to have killed Mohammed Emwazi  the terrorist know as  Jihadi John   saying;  this sends a message to the terrorists and their supporters that no matter how safe they feel in their Syrian enclave  they can still be reached wherever they are.

The EU budget has been increased by €10 billion to €155 billion after an agreement was made by the EU ‘Conciliation Committee’. David Cameron has on several occasions called for the EU budget to be reduced however his government has overseen a 6.9% rise in this year alone.  UKIP s Jonathan Arnott MEP said  “For the EU to increase its own budget by a whopping €10 billion euros and yet preach austerity at the same time displays a laughable level of hypocrisy. Last week the EU once again failed to obtain a clean bill of health from the auditors. This week we see them gifting themselves a €10 billion euro increase. It displays perfectly the convoluted and backward way Brussels operates.”
Tonight the House of Lords jumped the democratic shark  by voting to allow 16 and 17 year olds a vote in the upcoming EU Referendum. Joe Jenkins  the Chairman of the UKIP youth wing  Young Independence said:  This is a clear display of arrogance from an unelected and undemocratic body.   If the country wants 16 and 17 year olds to have the vote  this is something that would require a full national debate  and the forum for that is the elected House of Commons  not the Lords. The same people who want to give teenagers the vote  are the people who don t think that teenagers can judge for themselves over whether they should drink or smoke  but think they should be trusted with the country s future.   The House of Lords is supposed to be the repository of the nation s political wisdom  tonight they show themselves to be constitutional charlatans .
Details of the vast amounts of taxpayers’ money the EU spends promoting itself have been exposed in a new free to download booklet by UKIP Deputy Leader Paul Nuttall MEP. The publication offers voters a more balanced view of how cash is spent on pro-EU propaganda by Brussels bureaucrats and highlights the EU s extravagance  waste and propaganda. An institution which by the way has not had its accounts signed off for nearly 20 years.  He said: “Few people know a lot about the EU and its workings and I have put this booklet together to explain the basics in layman’s terms. It is vital that the public understands European Union spending ahead of the upcoming referendum.”  Download it at: http://www.ukip.org/eu_waste_exposed
UKIP Transport spokesman Jill Seymour MEP has accused the Driver and Vehicle Standards Agency of badly mishandling the introduction of new working terms for its staff.  “I feel huge sympathy for the people whose driving tests have been cancelled this week as a result of strike action by examiners  who have walked out alongside other vehicle and traffic safety staff ” she said.  “I do sympathise with these staff who are going to be taking on a greater workload  and I am concerned that forcing them to hold tests at night may well be illegal. The Public and Commercial Services Union is calling on the DVSA to conduct thorough research before making any changes  which seems a perfectly reasonable request. But in the meantime  the DVSA  the transport minister responsible  and the staff should all get round the table to resolve this for the benefit of all – the staff  and the general public who are sat on waiting lists.  “This whole situation has been badly mishandled. Strike action could have been easily avoided by properly consulting those who have to make the new regulations work.”

Speaking just after the announcement of the SDSR 2015 in Parliament  UKIP Defence Spokesman Mike Hookem MEP said   Mr Cameron can make statements about a military with more ships  more aircraft and new equipment  but following the 2010 review the UK s military has been at its smallest since the mid 19th century and our country has been left weakened.”   His headline policy of two 5000 strong  strike brigades  does not mean extra soldiers  it means reallocating already overstretched troops to new duties  rather than building our forces capabilities through a commitment to expanding personnel numbers.”  “This is all too typical of the type of smoke and mirrors defence policy we have come to expect from the Conservatives. In the summer they tried to fox voters with their creative accounting  slipping spending on security services into the defence budget to meet NATO s two per cent spending obligations. 
Need for a robust  flexible and value for money UK defence industry is more critical than ever says UKIP Defence Spokesman Mike Hookem MEP.   Every pound invested in the UK defence industry is a pound invested not only in the defence of the realm but also in British innovation  in highly skilled British jobs  in British technological developments that have a range of both military and civilian applications  and in the future of a highly skilled UK work force. 
A report today passed in the European Parliament has called for an EU seat on the UN Security Council and for the two permanent European members  the UK and France  to promote  common EU positions  on the council.   UKIP s James Carver MEP:  Time and time again we see the EU attempting to erode the UK s influence on the Security Council. The EU is repeating itself like a broken record and it is time we finally drew a line under this; the UK s UN Security Council seat is not up for negotiation.   It s shameful that their MEPs have once again put the EU s neo-colonialist ambition ahead of Britain s influence and security. 
Today in the European Parliament Plenary UKIP Deputy Leader Paul Nuttall MEP offered his condolences to the victims of the Paris attacks and their families. Speaking about the causes of the attack and potential solutions he said   We must first realise who our enemy is and who our enemy is not. We must not see foreign policy through the eyes of the student common room. We must come together to cut out the cancer of radical Islamism.   I warned in this chamber six weeks ago  to howls of derision  that freedom of movement of people in Europe would in the end lead to freedom of movement of jihad and I m afraid  unfortunately I was proven correct.

UKIP’s Economics Spokesman Mark Reckless: “The Chancellor has the wrong spending priorities and nowhere is that better illustrated than his sending on the Home Office and overseas aid. We’re seeing spending on overseas aid going from £11billion to £14billion - a quarter larger than what will be spent on the Home Office - and I think that’s absolutely extraordinary.   “UKIPs priority would be ensuring that all our armed forces serving abroad don’t pay income tax whilst on overseas deployment. Whereas by contrast the Government is looking at cutting some of the allowances whilst they are overseas.    There would be plenty of scope within the overseas aid budget to find that money times over and many people in this country would see that as a far greater priority. 
A must read from UKIP Leader Nigel Farage:  To take on Isis properly there will have to be a grand coalition. And we will need ground troops from all the North African  Arab and affected states. We will need to fight simultaneously in Nigeria  Kenya  Iraq  Syria  Libya and many other countries besides. And the West will have to swallow some pretty bitter pills.   I remember being denounced by Nick Clegg in our debates running up to the European Elections for saying that Putin was not our real enemy. That does not mean that I would invite Putin round for Sunday afternoon tea  but it does mean that on the battle against global jihadism we need to recognise that we’re on the same side. For many in Washington and London this is a difficult realisation. And dare one suggest that the same may even apply to Assad? However awful we may believe him to be.   In conclusion  I will back military action when I can see a proper plan with real co-ordination and the active involvement of ground troops from many affected countries. If the House of Commons votes as I believe it will for the current Cameron plan  we will be repeating the same mistakes again.

It has dragged down wages  lengthened social housing lists and stretched all public services  often to breaking point.

But it wasn’t for the lack of trying. We remain upbeat about our position as the third largest party in British politics  and we remain excited about the prospect of a referendum on Britain’s membership of the European Union.  They say in life  you win some  you lose some. Well we won in 2013  we won big in 2014. We’ve had some setbacks in 2015  but you know what that means don’t you? The next one’s a big win.

UKIP Deputy Leader Paul Nuttall MEP:  The experiment of postal voting on demand has failed. General election and local election turnouts were bigger in the 1980s and 1990s than they have been since the start of this century.   So if it has failed in its ultimate aim  why keep it? We know it leads to corruption  we know it denigrates our democracy  we know it prevents people from voting in secret and we know it doesn’t increase turnout.   It’s now time to consign postal voting on demand to the dustbin of history and I am going to do everything I can to make it happen.

Paul Nuttall said: “I am delighted to accept this role and look forward to carrying on Roger’s work. He has done a great job leading our MEPs in Brussels and Strasbourg and I intend to build on that to the very best of my ability.  “I am proud to be appointed to this role at such a historic and important time and will take it on whole-heartedly  just as my predecessor Roger did with considerable aplomb.”

News that some police forces in the UK feel hamstrung by political correctness when dealing with so-called honour crimes is “deeply disturbing”  says Louise Bours MEP. Her Majesty’s Inspectorate of Constabulary has reported that 3 out of 43 forces are “completely unprepared” to deal with such crimes – and that only 3 across the country were prepared. The BBC reports today that honour crime “is the name given to offences carried out by people claiming they are protecting their cultural and religious beliefs”.  Louise Bours said: “I find it deeply disturbing that many of our police forces feel hindered by political correctness gone mad.   “The police exist to protect people’s safety and welfare  not a misguided cultural ideology. They must start doing their job properly when it comes to abuse and violence of this kind. It is not good enough to say the police have been scared about being seen to be racist. PC is supposed to stand for Police Constable  not Politically Correct. 
Nathan Gill MEP  UKIP s spokesman for International Development  said: “Every time we see major flooding in the UK we are told it is unprecedented and little could have been done to help. I totally disagree.   It seems utterly wrong that the Government is spending almost twice as much money on ‘environmental’ aid abroad as it does on protecting people against severe weather in the UK.   Recent patterns show that increasing numbers of houses have been built on flood plains and there is a growing propensity for flash floods due in part to urbanisation.

UKIP Leader Nigel Farage:  It is clear that something is very wrong in our education establishment and that the views of our youngsters are having to endure by anti-UKIP  pro-EU bias.   It is also clear that a financial  funding element is in play for Universities. The way in which some lecturers and teachers are seeking to push the establishment line  sometimes in an aggressive manner  is frankly shocking.   The one big beaming ray of light we have is that thanks to the internet  young people no longer have to rely on the warped views of those seeking to push their views onto students. YouTube  Facebook and Twitter are game-changers that have opened-up the political process to our young people in a way that is truly exciting for those of us who believe in proper national state democracy.

These figures show 410 000 people have claimed asylum in the EU between August and September including a 60% increase for the UK.  Diane James MEP  the UKIP Home Affairs Spokesman said   These figures are enormous and extraordinary. They are a direct result of Mrs Merkel s siren call to peoples to come to the EU.    The equivalent of a  Migrant s Pandora s box  has been opened and unleashed. The vast majority may well be genuine asylum seekers but there is clearly going to be a significant number masquerading as such.

UKIP Leader Nigel Farage: EU free movement is making our country less safe.
UKIP Transport spokesman  Jill Seymour MEP has accused the Government of turning a blind eye to growing security problems in Calais  where British lorry drivers are risking their lives running the gauntlet of migrants armed with guns  baseball bats  metal bars and knives.  “The situation has disappeared from the UK news headlines in recent months  but for hauliers who are using the Channel Tunnel  the situation has never been more dangerous.  “My heart goes out to these innocent drivers who are simply trying to make a living  yet finding their cabs coming under attack from increasingly organised and desperate gangs. It is an appalling situation  and one which the British and French governments seem content to ignore. The way they are apparently turning a blind eye is absolutely appalling – a disgrace.”
Mass migration from Europe has suppressed wages and caused housing shortages in London – and the best way to address such concerns is by backing Britain leaving the EU says Peter Whittle  UKIP Mayoral Candidate for London. Whittle says that if elected mayor  he would work to address the housing shortage in the capital – but says one “cannot break the link” between housing and “uncontrolled migration”.  “I’ve had arguments with people who talk about housing. They talk about the need for more housing without addressing the demand side. They talk totally about the supply side. You cannot build without knowing how many people are coming into London  into the country.”  “This is about space. It is purely about space ” he says  adding he will push for new rules giving Londoners who have lived in councils for five years or more first preference for council housing.
UKIP International Development Spokesman Nathan Gill: “Aircraft Carriers  space programme  bullet trains and £300 million per annum in UK aid is not bad really when you think about it.  “Pity our forces are strapped for cash  our trains are packed and creaking  we have pitiful investment in high tech research and huge areas of national life underfunded. What priorities does our government really have  as they certainly aren’t those of this country?”

 Another European summit and yet another power grab. It s funny every single time a European Union policy fails  and that s pretty often  the demand is more centralisation and more Europe.   Watch and share UKIP Leader Nigel Farage s latest speech in the European Parliament
UKIP Defence Spokesman  Mike Hookem MEP has reacted furiously to news that ministers are to freeze the pensions of 140 000 veterans and widows in 2016-2017 saying  “This move is an utter betrayal of everything the military covenant stands for.”  “Despite all the guarantees of honouring the military covenant and the government’s spin during the recent SDSR of improving the lot of our armed forces  Cameron is leaving veterans and war widows out in the cold.”  “This pensions freeze is utterly two faced when you consider how only a few weeks ago  ministers were pushing to send our brave forces into action once again. It seems the while ministers are very quick to send our forces in to battle  they feel no need to repay their bravery and loyalty when veterans need the help.”
UKIP MEP Bill Etheridge:  I ask our Prime Minister a simple question; Mr Cameron  yes or no  are you in favour of EU membership for Turkey?   The leader of the Conservative MEPs made it perfectly clear his position on Turkey today and I commend him for his honesty. I am however interested in whether the Prime Minister shares his opinion. Mr Cameron has been adamant in the past that Turkey should join and I suspect his position is unchanged.    I speak for the whole of UKIP when I unequivocally say Turkey should not join the EU.

UKIP Deputy Leader Paul Nuttall MEP: “It is staggering that the Home Office has lost almost as many people as would fit into Wembley Arena. Worse still it doesn’t think it is worth their while to make the effort to check.   “And that is before we even consider the 30 000 people who having failed in their application are still in the country. That’s a reasonably sized town - illegal and off the books.   “Home Secretary Theresa May and her department talk a good game but they are clearly not fit for purpose.”
UKIP Leader Nigel Farage on BBC News this morning: Mr. Cameron s renegotiation project designed to keep the UK inside the EU is now in real trouble.
UKIP Leader Nigel Farage:  It is bad enough that this government is now running net migration at over a third of a million every year. It is even more shameful that they seem to be covering up what could actually be the real  far higher numbers.   The government must now release the full data they have for numbers of EU migrants they have coming to the UK rather than attempting to hide their appalling record just so it’s easier for Mr. Cameron to appease Mrs. Merkel in Brussels. They have allowed EU migration to run totally out of control. They should be made to stand by their shameful record rather than be allowed to sweep the true figures under the carpet. 
Moldovans with Romanian passports free to come to the UK. Inside the EU we simply do not control our own borders.
UKIP Migration Spokesman Steven Woolfe MEP:  Since I have been the UKIP spokesman on Migration  along with UKIP Leader Nigel Farage  I have been arguing that mass uncontrolled migration pushes down the wages of the low paid in Britain. This is not the first report which came to the same conclusion. In fact  Bank of England Governor  Mark Carney also recently accepted that unsustainable levels of migration causes wage compression some time ago. 
According to the housing charity Shelter 103 000 children will be homeless during this Christmas. A seven year high. Homelessness has increased in our country for the fifth consecutive year. In London alone the number of renters becoming homeless has increased by a staggering 700 per cent in the last five years.  UKIP Housing Spokesman Andrew Charalambous said   It s time the Government showed some compassion to our ever increasing homeless population. We at UKIP are demanding that government should start by ensuring homeless persons have full access to a GP  mental health professionals  optical and dental care .
As UKIP Health Spokesman Louise Bours MEP says:  This is a disgrace  it is nothing more than a tax on the sick 
UKIP Leader Nigel Farage:  This fat bonus will only encourage Juncker to fail again and fail bigger. With Schengen falling apart and the security threat now very real we should ask why Juncker is getting rewarded for failure.   As the number and scope of EU laws from the Commission decreases to there is an increase in the number and pay of EU Parliamentary staff. This means more people are getting paid more money to do less work and this is unacceptable to British taxpayers.

Mike Hookem MEP has sympathised with people hit by the unprecedented Christmas flooding saying  “My heart goes out to those all those affected”; while slamming the government for “ignoring the abject misery  disruption and damage caused by flooding” in favour of “pouring billions into vanity projects such as HS2”.  “I think I speak for the thousands whose Christmas has been cut short when I say most people in the UK would rather see some of the billions slated for HS2 spent on flood defences instead.”

 New rules in force next year will prevent recreational anglers from taking home any bass in the first half of the year. Non-anglers could be forgiven for not feeling particularly worried about which type of fish graces the Farage dining table. But actually this nonsensical policy provides a demonstration of much that is wrong with the EU.   For a start it shows the extent to which the Eurocrats are desperate to meddle in our affairs. They are now even claiming the right to influence how we spend our leisure time.   Not only is this legislation meddlesome it is also – like so many of the diktats that emanate from Brussels – poorly thought out. 
What more can we add? Hit Like if you d like to see Nigel Farage debate the EU with Jeremy Corbyn.
It has been nearly two years since Nigel Farage defeated then-Liberal Democrat leader and Deputy PM Nick Clegg in the European Union membership debates ahead of the 2014 EU elections. Now Mr. Farage has turned his guns to the new Labour leader  Jeremy Corbyn saying: “If you are really serious about engaging the public Mr. Corbyn  what about debating me on EU membership?”  If the debate goes ahead  Mr. Corbyn can expect to answer Mr. Farage on the question of TTIP  which both left and right wing voters are concerned will hand even more power to the EU  especially in areas such as the NHS.  Do you think Jeremy Corbyn will take up Nigel s challenge?
EU membership forecast to cost UK £96 billion between 2016 - 2020. Remaining in the EU would cost us big time!

UKIP s Defence Spokesman Mike Hookem MEP has slammed French government plans to build a “massive” refugee camp near an existing shanty town in Grande-Synthe  Dunkirk  saying  the French were “kidding themselves” if they thought the new £1.1 million centre would “defeat people traffickers and protect truck drivers in the port region”.  Mr Hookem  who was threatened with a gun in the nearby Teteghem refugee camp in August last year said; “Congregating migrants in one massive camp is exactly the wrong thing to do and will put extra pressure on police  port security  Immigration officials and truckers in the region. In fact these plans will essentially make the entire Dunkirk-Calais region an absolute no go area for British hauliers.”

Leaving the EU is more important than party politics write UKIP Leader Nigel Farage  Labour MP Kate Hoey and Conservative MP Tom Pursglove.
UKIP Leader Nigel Farage: The EU referendum will be the biggest political decision we take in our lifetime.
 It is clear that the West as a whole lacks cultural confidence. Quite frankly I’m tired of speeches from David Cameron and Theresa May who seek to assert values but do nothing. We get words but very little action.   The shocking scenes in Cologne are not far removed from us here in the United Kingdom. Whilst these men may not have EU passports  they soon will. They will then be free to come to the streets of Britain.   Ultimately this whole question of border controls  identity and security are issues on which the referendum will be determined. We are at a cross-roads as a country and a continent. For the good of our people and our nation  we must leave the European Union and start standing up for our Judeo-Christian heritage.   Do you agree with UKIP Leader Nigel Farage?

UKIP Deputy Leader Paul Nuttall MEP demands government release details on migrant settlement plans after Cologne scandal - “David Cameron and his government should immediately release the details  in a centralised fashion  as to whereabouts these new influxes of people are being settled. Police forces across the country should be compelled to report crimes and the exact background of any suspects as a matter of total transparency. 
UKIP calls on Energy Secretary to drop the playground technologies and get back to reality  Energy Secretary Amber Rudd has reportedly said that leaving the EU would have “unknown consequences”  for Britain’s energy security and energy pricing  and that “Britain would lose its influence on European energy markets”. She advances this as a reason to stay in the EU.  UKIP Energy spokesman Roger Helmer MEP responded saying   Energy Secretary Amber Rudd is hopelessly out-of-touch with the basics of energy pricing. 
UKIP Deputy Leader Paul Nuttall MEP writes:  Most of us can only imagine the horrors of war.   Sure  we see the clips of fire and terror on television. We hear the bombs on the radio. We read about the aftermath and the destruction.   But we don’t actually live it  thankfully. Because we have an enormously brave set of men and women who do that for us in our armed forces. 
UKIP Leader Nigel Farage has challenged Welsh First Minister Carywn Jones over his record in protecting Welsh steel  ahead of a major EU debate in Cardiff tonight  as 16 000 jobs are at risk at the UK’s largest steelworks in Port Talbot.  He has called on the First Minister to defy EU regulations that have seen energy prices soar  making production unsustainable  and also prevent mechanisms that could help to save heavy industry  such as using the vast Welsh coal reserves for cheaper energy supply  and blocking the UK government from providing any financial assistance.   Carwyn Jones has a duty to his electorate to ‘defy’ the EU if he wants to save the steelworks in Port Talbot  and the livelihoods of thousands of men and women in Wales who depend upon it.

Jonathan Arnott MEP urges Labour politicians to come clean over EU funding.  A UKIP member of the European Parliament has urged Labour politicians to  come clean  over EU funding. In recent weeks  there have been plenty of calls for the UK to apply for EU cash to help flooding victims and those who have lost their jobs in the steel industry  from two pots of funding known as the Globalisation Adjustment Fund and the Solidarity Fund. But UKIP MEP Jonathan Arnott  who is a member of the European Parliament s Budget Committee  reveals that they re not quite telling the full story in either case.
UKIP Transport spokesman Jill Seymour MEP today repeated her call to step up security for British travellers after a school bus was attacked by migrants from the Calais ‘Jungle Camp’.  The infamous settlement  near the entrance to the Channel Tunnel  is now home to an estimated 7 000 migrants  who are intent on trying to find a way to smuggle themselves into the UK.  Earlier this week  a coach full of British schoolchildren returning from a trip to Italy was attacked by a gang  who pelted the vehicle with bricks and smashed a window. It is believed the trauma of the attack caused one child to suffer an epileptic fit.  Mrs Seymour said: “These migrants are resorting to increasingly desperate measures in their efforts to reach Britain.
UKIP’s Employment Spokeswoman Jane Collins MEP has welcomed Toyota’s vow to remain in the UK  whatever the result of the EU referendum.   Three million jobs are not at risk if we vote for independence  instead we have the opportunity to be a country free from Brussels bureaucracy which is open for business. The only jobs at risk are the lobbyists  European Commission staff and of course MEPs like myself.   EU regulation has cost this country jobs; just look at the steel industry for one example. The sooner we can throw off the shackles of the EU the better off we will all become. 
Diane James MEP says ‘As long as Britain is in the EU  we are Treaty bound to abide by rulings from the European Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg.     British people should make their own laws and have them interpreted by the British Supreme Court. Otherwise we will continue to be burdened with judgements like this made by judges that we did not appoint.’
UKIP Mayoral candidate Peter Whittle writing in his new column for Breitbart London:  Mayors have varying degrees of power and influence. But one thing they have in common is a unique position from which they can – and should – speak for and to the people of their cities.   This power might be a purely cultural one  but it is hugely important.   So on this basis alone  the response last week of Cologne’s Mayor Henriette Reker to the mass attacks on women which took place on New Year’s Eve and which were then covered up by a dutiful police force and media  was utterly shameful.   Read the rest of the piece at the link below...
UKIP Defence Spokesman  Mike Hookem MEP has blasted a call by former Labour Prime Minister  Tony Blair  for the creation of an EU army  saying his comments were nothing more than “self interested bluster from a man some believe to have mislead both the UK and the UN in co-authoring the Iraq war”  but who seemed determined to continue his attempts to “find a role on the EU gravy train.”  “Tony Blair has never made any secret of being an arch Europhile and it is no surprise that he continues to cosy up to the EU.”  “The sad fact is that the creation of a European army would spell the end of the principle of the nation state and once and for all destroy the UK’s national integrity and security.”
UKIP Leader Nigel Farage writes for Breitbart:  Don’t believe the spin. The European Union’s drive towards centralisation continues at break-neck speed.   This was illustrated just last night when a report – an ultimate EU wish list – was discussed in the European Parliament by the federalist fanatics in Brussels. The title of the report reads: “On improving the functioning of the European Union building on the potential of the Lisbon Treaty”.   A working document  which will soon become a draft report  was drawn up by Elmar Brok. One of the most experienced and certainly the most powerful and well connected of MEPs who acted as co-rapporteur  he is Chairman of the Parliament’s Foreign Affairs Committee and regarded as Angela Merkel’s ‘Vicar on Earth’ in Brussels. When he makes a proposal you can be sure it is with the knowledge and approval of Germany’s Frau Merkel. And in the EU these days  what Angela wants  Angela gets. 
UKIP Leader Nigel Farage says:  This EU referendum campaign will be the people against the politicians  and perhaps the more the politicians club together  the more the people will vote against them. 
With net migration into Britain now running at over a third of a million a year the impact on Britain’s infrastructure has been huge  whether we talk about transport  policing or school places.

UKIP Leader Nigel Farage says the upcoming Brexit vote is about the safety and security of British women. Contrasting the enthusiastic welcome for migrants in September at Munich train station with its closure on foot of terrorist threats a few months afterwards  he criticised the unacceptable sexual assault of many women in Cologne and across Northern Europe.  These events have brought about a sea change of public opinion regarding the EU s open border policy:  Just to give you an idea of how big the sea change has been  the Daily Telegraph commentator  Allison Pearson  who had said she was undecided on Brexit  she didn t have enough information  wrote this the other day  she said:    After Cologne  the EU referendum is about nothing less than the safety and security of British women. We  the euro clueless  need to woman up and vote for the right of our daughters and granddaughters to live as they choose and to smile in the street. No more Mrs don t know  let s get the hell out. 
UKIP s Jane Collins MEP:   For me this referendum is now about protecting our way of life and the values that we hold dear; it’s about controlling who comes to the UK and the way they act when they arrive.   It’s about not letting a foreign leader dictate to the British people how many people we must take in each year. And it is about protecting the hard won rights of women and girls  the same rights that we as women have enjoyed up to now. I want girls to be able smile in the street and live their lives freely  without the prospect of having to fight off sexual predators every time they go into town or get on public transport.   That’s why it’s time to put to one side the “better the devil you know” caution and vote for an independent Britain that is part of Europe  but free of the EU. 
Speaking to the Dutch Prime Minister  Mark Rutte  in the European Parliament today in a debate on the forthcoming Dutch Presidency of the Council of the EU  UKIP Leader Nigel Farage spoke of a Eurosceptic contagion spreading across Europe  citing the UK  the Netherlands and Ireland among others.   The EU faces an existential crisis  indeed there is an outbreak of a contagious disease. The disease is called democracy and people want to have a say on their future.    Whether we the peoples of Europe can break this union between now and the end of June  I don t know  but I tell you what  we re going to have a damn good go. 
UKIP s Tim Aker MEP says:  We are not alone  millions of people across Europe are sick and tied of the European Union.   LIKE if you agree.
UKIP’s London Mayoral Candidate Peter Whittle writes for Breitbart London:  David Cameron’s announcement that Muslim women should make sure their English improves  or otherwise risk their right to stay in Britain  had all his now familiar hallmarks: clumsy  disingenuous  riddled with unverifiable assumptions  and ripped apart within 24 hours.  The idea that a married women could be deported because of inadequate English  when we cannot even seem to deport hate preachers and the aiders and abetters of terrorism  will rightly strike most of us as laughable.
UK Independence Party (UKIP) added a new photo to the album: Timeline Photos.
Do you agree with UKIP Leader Nigel Farage?   For too many years any criticism of immigration numbers or its effects on society have been shut down by the loud cry of “racism”.   The Labour Party have done this as a means of covering up the damage they did to our country. And as I saw this week they’ve still not learnt their lesson.

UKIP MEP Margot Parker writes about the launch of Grassroots Out last weekend:  Now we have the chance to inform the public all about Brexit and how we would be better off out of the EU and we must not let political divisions get in the way. Those who want to leave the EU must band together in a decision that comes high above any party politics.   The people of this country deserve the chance to govern themselves  to control their own borders  to free themselves from the strangulation of red tape and laws made in Brussels  to win back democracy and to restore it to Westminster.

Havering Council is set to become the first publicly-elected body in Britain to vote to leave the European Union  thanks to Cllr Lawrence Webb  UKIP s Leader on the Council  who has laid down the gauntlet for councils up and down the country to follow suit.  The motion reads: “Due to the negative impact that EU directives such as the agency working time directive and EU procurement rules have on the ability and cost of Havering Council to fulfil its obligations  this council agrees that Britain would be better off outside the European Union.   Peter Whittle  UKIP s London mayoral candidate  said:  Havering s vote will finally nail the lie that London is pro Britain s membership of the EU. Increasingly people in London understand that Leave is the sensible option for this great city. 
UKIP Deputy Leader Paul Nuttall MEP has reacted angrily to the possibility of council tax bills being hiked in flood hit areas.  The idea of local authorities raising funds for flood defences through council tax  based on a Somerset scheme  is being supported by Environment Secretary Liz Truss.  “Many people in my constituency  particularly in Cumbria  have suffered terribly from flooding problems in the last few months and with the awful prospect of even more potential problems in the next few days and weeks ” said Mr Nuttall  Deputy UKIP Leader.
UKIP s National Spokesman and EFDD Group Co-ordinator on International Trade  William Dartmouth MEP has written to the Financial Times to correct the myths that still about over access to the EU single market.  In his letter  William  MEP for the South West of England  makes the point that   Norway is not UKIP’s blueprint on Brexit. It never has been — nor  for that matter  Switzerland either.   He also reiterates UKIP s position that the UK  as the fifth-largest economy in the world  that runs a massive trade deficit with the EU  could negotiate its own tailor-made agreement and if that is not forthcoming  the UK would trade with the EU  as do six of the top 10 exporters to the EU  and 11 of the top 20  under World Trade Organisation rules.
Havering Borough Council voted 30 to 15 to support the motion that the UK would be better without the EU. UKIP’s Group Leader in Havering  Cllr Lawrence Webb  who produced the motion  hailed the landmark vote and hoped others would followed suit.  “It is a fantastic result. We as local councillors have to make decisions on rules and regulations that come out of the EU. They have a direct impact on local services.”   It is important that message gets out. Hopefully  after last night  other councils will be minded to have a vote and we will have a better  more honest  open debate. 
UKIP Defence Spokesman  Mike Hookem MEP has branded the decision to import 5 000 tonnes of steel for use in construction of the Royal Navy’s new aircraft carriers - while thousands of British steelworkers face a life on benefits after being laid off - as “a national disgrace”; saying  “while Labour shout about job losses in the steel industry  their wholehearted support for the EU project reveals their true colours.”  “Labour has been very quick to blame the government for the thousands of redundancies in the British steel industry  and in highlighting that our newest warships are being built using foreign steel  but at the same time they are careful not to mention the EU legislation that creates this situation in the first place.”

The European Committee of Social Rights  which is part of the Council of Europe  wants children’s paper rounds outlawed as they believe it could harm their education.   UKIP Deputy Leader Paul Nuttall MEP:  “This is ridiculous utter nonsense and as their findings are not binding on us I trust that the UK will do the only sensible thing and ignore it.  “It is one of the few ways that teenage school children can legitimately make a couple of bob and the responsibility it carries imbues them with a sense of self-worth. Far from harming their education it teaches them the importance of punctuality and hard work.

Suggestions by Britain in Europe campaigner Baroness Brady that football clubs would be unable to sign continental players were today rubbished by Paul Nuttall MEP  the UKIP Deputy leader and former Tranmere footballer responded to the suggestions by the In campaign spokeswoman    Baroness Brady is so badly mistaken I suspect she is just saying this drivel as a way of thanking Cameron for her peerage.   She must know that the number of international players in the UK coming from Africa and Latin America prove there would be no visa difficulties for talented players coming to British clubs from Europe. Players from over 100 countries have played for Premiership clubs  and current rules are biased in favour of players from the 27 EU countries  making it harder for clubs to recruit from across the world. Clubs and players need a level playing filed.
In October 2014 Jackie Doyle-Price posted on her Facebook page that she had  stopped (the) new crossing .  Cllr Tim Aker MEP said:  It is completely outrageous that Jackie Doyle-Price found it acceptable to lie to residents that she personally had stopped a new Thames Crossing.   I call on her to release the communications with the government showing exactly where they stated the new crossing wasn t going to happen or to come and apologise personally to all residents affected along the planned routes.
The TUC General Secretary  Frances O’Grady by her slavish endorsement of the European Union shows that she no longer cares about British workers. By supporting Britain’s continued membership of the European Union  Jane Collins  the UKIP Employment spokesman responded   Britain s unions have shown their allegiance to the multinational companies who make money from cheap labour provided by the EU.  “If they were really on the side of the British worker they d be fighting for Brexit.

UKIP Deputy Leader Paul Nuttall MEP  “Despite entering February the Westminster panto season continues. The theatrics and drama of David Cameron’s sham renegotiation continues and he is playing us for fools.  “On the one hand we have Donald Tusk leaving a set piece dinner saying “No deal” and on the other hand Cameron’s assertion after that same meeting that it had been a good one.  “In 24 hours when  to no doubt great fanfare  Cameron returns with a “Deal” with Brussels it’ll looks like it’ll be nothing more than tinkering round the edges of our relationship with the European Union and will not go any way to dealing with the wholesale loss of sovereignty to the EU  the eye-watering cost of it  or indeed go any way to bring back genuine control of our borders from the EU.  “In short  don’t be fooled  again  by Cameron’s ongoing charade.”
UKIP s Jane Collins has warned the PM s  emergency brake  will be  as useful as the state aid rules which denied the government the right to help our steel industry.   All Mr Cameron has managed to negotiate is another method of  going to Brussels with a begging bowl when the inevitable consequences of EU membership puts too much of a burden on the UK economy.    The deal is so convoluted  with so many coloured cards to wave around if EU legislation is not wanted  that MPs will be more like primary school teachers trying to teach toddlers the colours of the rainbow. But it still doesn t address the fundamental problems of sovereignty and of democratic accountability  of uncontrolled migration driving down jobs and the British tax payer topping up low salaries with tax credits. 
UKIP Leader Nigel Farage:  President of the European Council makes clear today:  The line I did not cross  however  were the principles on which the European project is founded .   EU membership means free movement of people. Only way we can control our borders is to Leave EU.   David Cameron s Bloomberg speech promised far-reaching EU reform. Today we see fiddling at the edges. No fundamental change. 
Here s the truth about Cameron’s EU “Deal” ✓ No treaty change ✓ No repatriation of powers ✓ EU law remains supreme ✓ £55m handed over every day ✓ Open borders  Share this to spread the word
Cameron s  renegotiation  getting the reception it deserves -  Nigel Farage labelled it as  pathetic   what do you think?
UKIP Leader Nigel Farage s latest speech in the European Parliament:  If the question in June was should we join the EU we d have to tell the British people you have to surrender the control and sovereignty of your parliament and have 75 percent of your laws made somewhere else.   Your supreme court will not be supreme; you will be overruled by a court of Luxembourg made up by people who aren t even judges.   You will have to give up your fishing grounds  including in some places 200 miles of the North Sea. And you must cut your links with the Common Wealth and the wider world because you are no longer fit to negotiate your own global trade deals.   Oh  and by the way for all of this you will be paying 55 million pounds a day as a membership fee. 
Nigel Farage on BBC News:  British voters want the primacy of UK Law  they want the EU to cost us less money and they want back border controls. And as for the red card  its hardly a British veto is it!   What do you think of David Cameron s shambolic renegotiation?

UKIP Leader Nigel Farage:  David Cameron  by championing this pathetic deal  has shown that he just doesn’t believe we are good enough to blaze our own trail in the world.   Those of us who believe in this country and what we can achieve must come together  win this referendum and get our country out of the EU. Together we can do it.   Will you help the campaign to Leave the EU?
UKIP s Louise Bours MEP: Looking forward to chairing the Grassroots Out event in Manchester on Friday  great line up of speakers including UKIP Leader Nigel Farage; get your tickets here...
Do you agree with UKIP Deputy Leader Paul Nuttall MEP?
UKIP Leader Nigel Farage:  In the wake of David Cameron’s really rather pathetic little deal the EU referendum is all over the front pages.   However  I have been alarmed to hear that Vote Leave’s campaign director  told a group of UKIP MEPs that a double referendum might be the way to get some senior figures into the campaign.   The idea that we should win a referendum on leaving the EU and then be offered better terms to vote a second time to become associate members appals me and I could not countenance working with anyone who suggested that idea. 
With the unanimous support of our MEPs we are now committed to supporting the new Grassroots Out campaign and we now ask our branches and members to join with GO as a means of working with activists from other parties and none. Full details of how this will work will be explained at our Llandudno Spring Conference later this month.   The aim of GO is for us to campaign together on the ground and to hold a series of big public meetings across the UK.  Full details of how this operation will work will be explained at our Llandudno Spring Conference later this month. You can find out more about Grassroots Out at www.grassrootsout.co.uk/   So let us organise and mobilise our people’s army around the GO banner for this referendum!
If you weren t able to make it to the Grassroots Out event in Manchester featuring UKIP Leader Nigel Farage you can watch the livestream here from 7pm
UKIP Leader Nigel Farage:  What we hear all the time is that Britain isn t big enough to stand on her own two feet and govern ourselves.   “That Britain needs to be part of this bigger club to negotiate trade deals  that unless we are part of this political union we couldn t buy ourselves goods from each other.  “In fact what our political class believe is that Britain isn t good enough for us to run our own country. Well I believe in Britain and I believe we are good enough to run our own country.   Like if you agree with Nigel.
UKIP Leader Nigel Farage:  Huge enthusiasm in Manchester at Grassroots Out last night to Leave the EU. We want our country back! 
UKIP Leader Nigel Farage:  If we remain in this European Union we will be even more vulnerable to terrorism and to the kinds of scenes that we saw in Cologne on New Year’s Eve. The logical  practical and safe thing to do is to cut our ties with a failing political union and take back control of our lives.   All it needs to defeat the big banks  the vested interests of the big businesses and our craven politicians is for you to believe in Britain and vote to leave this European Union.   Do you think we’re good enough? 
What does Mr Farage believe will be the defining issue in the referendum  pencilled in for June? “This cause is very emotive. It always has been.  “The evidence is  if you look at the polling of undecided voters  by far the top issue that could swing them to ‘Out’ is  not just immigration  but security ” Mr Farage says.  Read the rest of Nigel Farage s interview with the Sunday Telegraph here...
UKIP s Mayoral Candidate Peter Whittle talks to Business Insider about how immigration is driving up house prices.
UKIP’s Migration Spokesman Steven Woolfe MEP: “The baseless statements from David Cameron and the Remain camp that France will scrap its bilateral Calais border control agreement with the UK leaving our country vulnerable to illegal immigration and Calais-like  Jungle  camps on the south coast are based on fears  negativity and a falsehood.   Membership of the European Union is not a prerequisite for this agreement and it was negotiated and signed between two nation-states. The EU had nothing to do with this deal  and that s probably why it has worked for the past decade. Saying that France will unilaterally scrap this agreement is like suggesting that France will also scrap the Treaties on Defence and Security which the Prime Minister himself signed in 2010.

Following Friday’s announcement of unanimous support by UKIP MEPs for the Brexit campaign Grassroots Out  the Chairman of the UKIP Councillors Association David Sprason has called for all UKIP Councillors to follow suit and back Grassroots Out.  David Sprason said  It is clear to me that the only group who are actually engaging with people on the doorstep is  Grassroots Out . It reflects the work UKIP Councillors carry out on a regular basis so I think it is time that all UKIP Councillors support and get behind Grassroots Out. It has proved to be a truly cross party campaign working to get us out of the undemocratic EU

Professor Angus Dalgleish  one of Britain’s leading cancer experts  warns that being part of the EU puts “intolerable strain on the NHS” and that it “could collapse completely”. He is undoubtedly correct that unfettered migration and the rise of health tourism have put huge pressure on the health service. And it does not stop there. Professor Dalgleish is also worried about Brussels regulations which have hindered medical research and made it harder for the NHS to deliver service and training.  Professor Dalgleish deserves credit for standing up for his patients by speaking the truth. Not many of his colleagues have had the guts to do the same. Meanwhile those campaigning to keep us in the EU cannot help resorting to scare tactics and talking about the risks of leaving.
UKIP Leader Nigel Farage:  It is clear that immigration is the number one issue and concern for the British people and will be the defining issue of this EU referendum campaign.   The fact that we can only control our borders if we leave the European Union  that we can only ever get an Australian-style points system as an independent country outside of the EU is clearly an argument that has massive appeal out there across the country. 
David Cameron s so-called  emergency brake  is an #EmergencyFake  Share if you Agree
UKIP Leader Nigel Farage;  If we vote to remain in the European Union we will be helpless to stop the spread of EU legislation that holds back our economic potential and makes life hard for those who run small businesses.   If we remain in this Union we will be even more vulnerable to terrorism and to the kinds of scenes that we saw in Cologne on New Year’s Eve.   The logical  practical and safe thing to do is to cut our ties with a failing political union and take back control of our lives. All it needs to defeat the big banks  the vested interests of the big businesses and our craven politicians is for you to believe in Britain and vote to leave this European Union.

As many areas in the north of England and Scotland struggle to return to normal life after months of flooding  residents live in fear of yet another heavy bout of rainfall which environment experts say could be avoided by simply dredging rivers.  But because of the EU’s European Water Framework Directive  rivers and streams are becoming blocked by rubbish as it “calls on countries to allow rivers to remain as close as possible to natural conditions”.  And despite the UK contributing £55million a day towards the EU  no money is yet heading towards Yorkshire  where some of the most severe flooding was.

Do you agree with Nigel Farage that Cameron is losing the EU Referendum debate  hit Like if you do
UKIP Leader Nigel Farage today joined protesters from all across Europe in a march against Chinese steel dumping onto the European market which is pushing prices down and making thousands of European steel workers redundant.   Whilst on the march Nigel Farage commented:  It is pathetic that the British government must go cap in hand to beg the European Commission to prevent dumping of Chinese steel which is causing huge job losses. In a nutshell  it encapsulates why we must have control of our own destiny and a government directly accountable to the British people rather than an unelected Commissioner in Brussels. 
UKIP leader Nigel Farage says he thinks the Prime Minister will secure a deal with EU leaders on reform of the EU  because  he hasn t asked for anything .   When he called this referendum just over two years ago  he said if I win the election the British people will get a vote  he talked about a fundamental change in our relationship with Europe  that isn t even being discussed.   And the key issue  the number one issue in Britain is can we reduce the levels of migration  coming into Britain from Europe and frankly the so-called deal doesn t even address that. 
UKIP Leader Nigel Farage on Cameron s  deal :  The real truth is that this deal is not worth the paper it’s written on. It is subject to European Parliamentary approval and ultimately judgements of the European Court of Justice.   I am not sure that this ‘deal’ is the kind of second hand car that the British public will buy from the Prime Minister. There is no reason to trust him.   This deal is no more than Cam’s sham.

ONS figures reveal the extent by which British workers are put under pressure by continued uncontrolled EU migration. The employment figures show graphically that 50% of new jobs created in the last year went were taken by people not born in the UK. Even more revealing is that 90% of those jobs were taken by EU nationals.  UKIP s Margot Parker said   Recent figures show that despite a slow increase in wages across the board three groups have not seen an improvement in a decade. Young people  the low waged and the BME community. Its is these groups  already at the bottom of the pile that are suffering from migration  and particularly uncontrolled low skilled migration from the European Union .   Those who are at the sharp end  ignored  and often help in contempt by the political establishment see none of the vaunted benefits of migration  benefits only visible to the multinational corporations and big government.
West Midlands UKIP MEP Bill Etheridge launched another broadside at the EU following the release of figures from the Regional Development Committee on which he sits.  The accounts show that between 2008 and 2015  the UK was awarded interim payments of just €4.3bn  in comparison to Poland who received a whopping €48bn. Estonia  a country of little more than 1.3 million people  saw investments in excess of €21bn.  “This is irrefutable evidence of the huge disparity of the benefits in belonging to the EU. It clearly shows that the UK would be better off out!”

UKIP Transport Spokesman Jill Seymour MEP has welcomed the public apology from the president of the AA after he back-tracked on claims that a British exit from the EU would lead to a hike in fuel prices.  The motoring group waded into the Europe debate today by claiming costs at the pumps could rise by 18.7p a litre  within days  of a Brexit vote. But AA president Edmund King later took to Twitter to apologise for the comments  admitting they had been ‘misinterpreted’ and were taken from on a report by banking group Goldman Sachs – known supporters of the ‘In’ campaign.  Mrs Seymour said: “I’m delighted that the AA has now apologised for this embarrassing piece of scaremongering  and clarified its stance on the matter. Goldman Sachs have a very vested interest in the EU referendum debate  so stating their claims as hard facts was a very unwise move.

UKIP London Mayoral candidate Peter Whittle said:  Its been a great pleasure to see both Boris and particularly Zac Goldsmith as my competitor in the Mayoral race come round to the position that we in UKIP have held for decades. We believe that Britain  and London in particular would be better off out of the European Union.   But we in UKIP believe that it is only by addressing mass uncontrolled inward migration that our membership of the EU guarantees can we do something about the appalling housing situation in London  a situation where it is almost impossible for Londoners to even dream of owning a house  and is crushing the dreams of millions of our young people.   It is essential that there is a strong UKIP voice in London to keep the establishment honest  and we are fighting for every vote that we can get. 
There is NO such thing as European funding. Its YOUR taxation and YOUR money!

The Labour group was a disappointment   they seem to have abandoned the working man and ignore the pressures on his wages and jobs. Tony Benn must be spinning in his grave.”

A message from UKIP Leader Nigel Farage:  We have an important set of elections on May 5th in which UKIP can make some significant breakthroughs. But at the same time we have to fight a referendum campaign and our frontline spokesmen need to be free to comment and campaign on the main issues.    Accordingly I have made some changes to our structure today. Both of our Deputy Chairs are candidates in the upcoming elections and this will limit any role they can play in the national referendum campaign. So I thank Suzanne Evans and Neil Hamilton for their time as Deputy Chairs and announce they will be replaced by Diane James and William Dartmouth.    Diane will have responsibility for speaking on the issue of security in the campaign and William on trade and jobs. I know that both are free to campaign on a full time basis.   ---  Congratulations to Diane James MEP and William Dartmouth in their new roles!

UKIP Employment Spokesman Jane Collins has said the ONS statistics showing the increase in young people not in education  employment or training released on the same day as MEPs voted to advertise all jobs and apprenticeships in the UK on an EU wide website  demonstrated how the EU has a negative effect on the prospects of young people in Britain.    There were 853 000 young people classed as NEET  up 5000 yet MEPs from the Tories  Labour and other UK parties will today vote through an extension of an EU scheme which has overwhelmingly seen UK jobs advertised and taken up by people from other EU countries.

I expect before too long to be told that a biblical plague of locusts will descend upon our country devouring all before it if we leave the EU.

On BBC Daily Politics today  UKIP s Diane James MEP said we can’t control our borders or the numbers coming in if we remain in the EU
UKIP s London Mayoral Candidate Peter Whittle:  I believe black cabs are an iconic part of London life. The service they provide is unique and the envy of cities around the world  and they offer Londoners the security of a properly regulated and licensed taxi service.     We believe in a level playing  and to this end if elected I would push for a temporary freeze on any further PHV licences being issued by City Hall. This would give us a breathing space in which to put in more vigorous and fairer qualifications with regard to PHV drivers. Not just a greater understanding of English  but proper health checks and where possible  criminal record checks. 
UKIP Energy Spokesman Roger Helmer has called the Opposition Day Debate on steel “a cynical attempt to make the steel industry think the Labour party are prepared to do anything about their plight.”  Roger Helmer who represents the East Midlands in the European Parliament  “Several EU policies – energy  state aids  anti-dumping action  or inaction  have converged to create an existential  crisis for the steel industry.  More generally  EU policies are impacting all energy-intensive industries and forcing investment and jobs out of the EU altogether.  “The Tory government could campaign for market economy status of China to be removed  thus letting Brussels take short term measures to ensure a level playing field but they don t. The only long term solution is to take control of matters ourself. 
UKIP Wales Leader Nathan Gill has slammed proposals to ban tackling in school sports  calling it  a fundamental aspect of the game.   “As a proud rugby playing nation  how will we develop a competitive first fifteen when Welsh school kids are being forced to play touch football in place of proper rugby? Tackling is a fundamental aspect of the game. I understand the importance of protecting childrens’ health and as a father of five I would be really concerned if any of my kids were being put at risk. But it’s the role of qualified Physical Education instructors to ensure school sports are played safely while talents are developed and skills encouraged. I am astonished that this is being proposed.   School kids have been playing rugby for generations. Why now is it suddenly being deemed a problem? It reflects an over protective nanny state that stifles innovation and progression.

UKIP s Mayoral Candidate Peter Whittle:  We have a chronic housing shortage in London. The difference for me is that so far in hustings and announcements. I have been trying to address both sides of the housing supply and demand equation. No one else is addressing the demand side.  “There can be no question in my mind that relatively uncontrolled migration for 15 to 20 years is the main driver of the housing crisis in London. The Mayor has the campaign power  he cannot control immigration and no one can because we are members of the European Union but he is in a unique position to say we need a more controlled system  and I will keep on saying this.

UKIP Business Spokesman Christopher Mills:  John Longworth may not represent the views of all of his members  however he has a fundamental right  at least for now  to express his views  views which he made clear were his own and not of the BCC.   Freedom of speech is vital for the good functioning of both society and business and it shocking that the BCC should threaten his livelihood for expressing a point of view that is accepted by millions of ordinary people in this country. 
Deputy Chairman and Trade Spokesman William Dartmouth comments:  The Swiss Government are clearly doing the right thing. They are tearing up the Treaty clause of free movement of people now it has become unworkable.     Would that the Prime Minster and the UK Government do something similar. Cameron s failed negotiations show he never had the belief or bottle to get anything worthwhile from Brussels. When there is a problem the Swiss Government act  whereas the British government sit on their hands  why  because the Swiss are a free nation  and until we leave the EU  we are not. 
UKIP Leader Nigel Farage has been in Thornbury today addressing UKIP s South West Conference  speaking at he said  This is our once in a lifetime opportunity to get our country back.   He later took his campaign to Thornbury High Street  and to help the Grassroots Out action day. To dispel what he called  the fears spread by politicians and the Prime Minister  who believe Britain would be better off and better protected staying in the EU .  In traditional Farage style the UKIP leader celebrated his canvassing with a visit to the nearest bar. Where he drank to the referendum and the chance to bring change to the country.  Will you be helping alongside Nigel in this Referendum campaign?
UKIP Leader Nigel Farage:  We must seize this golden opportunity to leave the European Union so that we can take back control of our borders — and once again control the quantity and the quality of those who wish to come to these shores.

UKIP Migration Spokesman Steven Woolfe MEP:  More than just placing untold pressure on our public services  open borders with the EU pose a serious risk to our national security – a risk that will only grow with Turkey’s inevitable accession to the EU within the next decade.   It means that if we stay in the EU we will open our borders to a rapidly growing population. It grew from under 50 million in 1985 to 78.7 million in 2015. It is projected to overtake Germany’s declining population by 2018 and reach over 95 million by 2050.    It is increasingly evident that remaining in the EU would seriously undermine our national security. While the government peddles the idea that quitting the EU would be a risk in unstable times  the real risk would be to remain within a European Union that continues to fail to deal with its migrant crisis and now wants to add to the problem.

UKIP Wales Leader Nathan Gill MEP  who gained the greatest votes across the entire UKIP Wales membership said  “The Welsh membership have now had their say  and I am glad that that our list candidates for the Welsh elections have now been confirmed.  “Now is the time for all of us to move forward united and to campaign to bring real change to the political establishment in Cardiff Bay. We have a great manifesto and a great message and I look forward to leading the UKIP Wales team from the front in the campaign ahead.”  You can see the full list in the link below:
UKIP Leader Nigel Farage said the only way to maintain border control was to get out of the EU.  “Britain must not become part of a common asylum system. That would be to abandon our borders and any chance of maintaining the slightest control over who can and who cannot arrive here.  “Cameron swears he will not accept it. But the European Union wants to rip up the rules that mean people stay in the first safe country they land in. If that happens there is nothing he can do. The only strong  safe option for the UK when it comes to our asylum process is to leave the EU.”
Hands off British ports – that’s the message to European Union officials from UKIP Transport spokesman Jill Seymour MEP.  “Unlike most of continental Europe  the UK has very competitive ports  with the lion’s share in the private sector. The EU has tried to regulate ports without success on two previous occasions  and this is the third attempt.    “As the majority of ports in the UK are privately owned  successful and efficient  it is not for the EU to regulate British ports. Port services regulation will do more harm than good  and the UK will be better off out.”
Today on International Women s Day UKIP MEP Margot Parker has outlined how the EU has failed women and is actually helping trafficking and exploitation. In two speeches to the EU Parliament in Strasbourg she outlined figures from Eurostat which showed that between 2010 and 2012  more than 30 000 people were trafficked across Europe - 80% of them women. She also outlined further statistics from the UK National Crime Agency  revealed in 2014  which show that more than 3 000 people were potential victims of trafficking  up by 21%.   These figures are only those reported - the real figures will be horrendously higher. What has all the EU gender legislation  spending and QUANGOs achieved for women? The only people the EU has helped are the cross-border traffickers and criminals because it forces us to have an open door to 27 other countries. 
UKIP Leader Nigel Farage:  It is pretty clear to me that a vote to remain is a vote for Turkey  a vote to remain is a vote for massively increased immigration into Britain and a vote to remain is a vote that makes Britain more vulnerable to terrorism. It is safer to vote to leave and take back control of our borders.   Like if you agree!

Iceland s PM has said his country is ready to open trade talks with the UK when we leave an increasingly German-dominated EU.  “When it comes to the big stuff the decisions are made by two  and increasingly one country   said Sigmundur Gunnlaugsson as he highlighted the diminishing power the UK wields in Brussels.  “The UK is one of our most important trading partners and whatever you decide to do we would like to have a free trade deal with you whether through the EEA or independently”.
UKIP s Jane Collins MEP said she was “not surprised a directive on cabbages was so long winded because the EU motto is “regulate everything then tax it. If the laws were short and to the point and on matters that actually needed legislation they wouldn’t have the excuse to employ so many people and occupy so many offices: there is probably a ‘green leafy vegetable’ department we’ve yet to uncover.   “Philosophies based on common sense don’t need endless reams of paper because people can use logic to understand principles of freedom  of liberty and of being kind to our neighbours.  “The EU is based on nonsense political doctrine so everything has to be spelled out to the letter because it makes no sense. Personally I think the only cabbages are the people who think the EU should be making our laws and taking our money.”

UKIP s Jane Collins MEP has dubbed the news that cosmetics giant Avon will be relocating its headquarters to the UK as  another blow to Project Fear and great news for Great Britain.    We ve had companies defy Mr Cameron and his team of letter writers in 10 Downing Street by saying they will remain in the UK if we vote to leave the EU but this is a new step as it s a company moving jobs here showing this country can thrive as an independent nation.   Rather than this nonsense about needing to be governed by Brussels for jobs and to attract inward investment this is direct proof that it s over regulation companies are leaving behind as Avon quit Obama s high tax country.

In this damning assessment of the machinations and falsehoods that have accompanied Britain’s membership of the European Union  UKIP Leader Nigel Farage  examines the role of the EU and British establishment in pulling the wool over the eyes of the British electorate.  His particular focus is twofold. Firstly  he examines the 1975 Referendum on membership of what was then called (misleadingly) the ‘Common Market’ and how in the forthcoming referendum  the same old spin will be used to try and mislead or mesmerise us  and  secondly  how a vote to remain in the EU will not be a vote for the status quo  but a vote to continue the decline of this nation’s sovereignty.

UKIP Leader Nigel Farage:  I m very upset by events in Brussels today and even more depressed for the future.   UKIP Deputy Leader Paul Nuttall MEP added:  Brussels is on lockdown. My thoughts and prayers go out to all of those affected. 
London and the South East continue to lead spiking house prices according to the Office of National Statistics. The government simply has no realistic response to the needs of an ever changing market and expanding population. So much so that the British people have little choice now in where they choose to live or bring up a family.  Peter Whittle  UKIP s candidate for London Mayor said   These new ONS figures just highlight what we have been saying all along  it is increasingly obvious that Londoners cannot afford to get onto the housing ladder and the sheer cost of housing increases the pressure on London services as key workers are driven further and further from the centre of the city. Until we address the issue of demand  demand driven mostly through immigration  then we will never be able to get a handle on the issue of supply and rapidly increasing costs. 
 EU membership and open borders make us less safe as a country.   Do you agree with Nigel Farage? Like if you agree.
Portsmouth City Council voted to support leaving the European Union  the first British city to declare for out. The motion proposed by UKIP was passed with a huge majority of 21-15. What this means practically is that Portsmouth City Council will not be able to use their taxpayer funded newsletters to the people of Portsmouth to stealth promote the European Union during the Referendum campaign.   Councillor Julie Swan  UKIP’s Deputy Group Leader who seconded the motion said  “I’m delighted that the Council has passed this motion. I wasn’t born the last time that the British people were allowed to vote on membership of the EU.   “It’s important to debate this once in a lifetime opportunity and to encourage the people of Portsmouth to get involved.

David McNarry MLA  UKIP’s Northern Ireland Leader  has welcomed Lord Trimble’s support for Brexit saying   The support of former First Minister  UUP Leader and Nobel Laureate  Lord Trimble  for Brexit shows that the tide of logic and practical economics is winning the argument.   The scaremongering by ‘better-off-in’ Yes men and Yes Women is not fooling thinking people. Voters are looking for informed arguments based on facts and reason to help them make up their minds and they are only getting this from the Brexit campaign. All they are getting from the ‘better-off-in’ brigade are discredited scare stories  increasingly wild and frankly laughable assertions. ‘Better-off-in’s’ scary fairy stories are better suited to the Brothers Grimm than the real world.   Brexit’s campaign is based on sound fact and argument and is backed by major players like former First Minister Lord Trimble and former Chancellor Lord Lawson.”
Happy Easter! From all at UKIP.
UKIP s Jill Seymour MEP has launched Women For Brexit (www.womenforbrexit.co.uk) a non-partisan campaign dedicated to highlighting the reasons why women should vote to leave the EU.  Jill Seymour MEP says: “We are women from all backgrounds  whether that be different political parties or different types of businesses.    “What was the point of those brave Suffragettes fighting for us to get the vote if we are now going to sit back and continue to allow unelected bureaucrats to decide what we can or can t do? 
Children should not be used as political pawns by left wing teachers intent on indoctrination  says UKIP Deputy Leader Paul Nuttall MEP .  “These are young impressionable minds they are playing with who should be taught what being British means above ideological views about international human rights.  “We are an island race and migrants have always settled here and being happily assimilated into our communities. And we have a fine record on taking in refugees from all over the world facing persecution and death. 
UKIP Defence Spokesman Mike Hookem MEP says  The Falkland Islands do not lie in Argentinian waters and the UN should not be altering customary international law for the sake of one country whose actions in 1982 cost over one thousand lives.   Argentina caused the death of 649 of their own men and 255 British servicemen with their illegal invasion of the Islands in 1982 and an additional 775 were wounded  predominantly to distract attention away from their disastrous economic situation.   After years of continued threats and bullying  including actions which are also illegal under international law such as the ban on certain flagged vessels  they want to get hold of the continental shelf surrounding the Falklands to try to boost their flagging coffers at the expense of the livelihoods of people who do not wish to be part of Argentina.

The decision of Tata to sell off the Port Talbot steelworks is a disaster for the workers and for the town.  It is also a direct result of EU polices.  We need to see it in context.  Port Talbot is merely the latest closure.  All over Europe  energy-intensive businesses are closing.  Jobs are being lost.  Investment is moving offshore  in search of cheaper energy and more realistic regulatory regimes.  UKIP is the only party prepared to face up to this situation  and the only party with practical policies to offer hope to workers under threat.
No really  they do want you to get in touch
UKIP s London Mayoral candidate Peter Whittle believes the ever increasing problem of a growing population needs to be dragged centre stage in the run up to May 5 when votes are cast.  “We have a real chronic housing crisis and we have the other candidates who refuse to acknowledge the main driver of that which is a radically increasing population. London is increasing at a phenomenal rate by about a million people every decade  so it does not matter how much you say you will build  unless you deal with that situation and that level of immigration.”  Read the rest of his latest interview here: http://www.romfordrecorder.co.uk/news/politics/ukip_hopeful_wants_to_bring_issues_of_immigration_centre_stage_in_mayoral_election_1_4462702

UKIP Mayoral candidate Peter Whittle:  This polling confirms what I ve been saying throughout my campaign. Immigration is a key issue for Londoners despite it being totally ignored by the other candidates. It affects every issue  including housing  and Londoners know this.    I will be the only London Mayoral candidate making the argument that we need to control our borders  and to do that we must leave the European Union.

UKIP London Mayoral candidate Peter Whittle:  It is deeply worrying that our libraries are potential incubators for extremism. There should of course be the freedom for genuine academic research to be undertaken  but unfiltered access  and not even a system of flagging in place  to extremist material has the worrying power to warp and twist minds.   It would be wise for libraries to introduce sensible controls to ensure they are places for open minds  not for closing them.

£172million is what we OVERSPENT on Foreign Aid last year by mistake - as sneaked out by the Government on Friday. That s enough to keep Port Talbot steel plant alive for six months  Why do the political classes still insist that we can afford to send nearly £1billion per month in aid to countries with space programmes and burgeoning middle classes whilst hard-working UK taxpayers struggle with the rising cost of living  face the likely prospect of never seeing a state pension and are burdened with the largest national debt in history?   UKIP believes it is time to reduce the international aid budget to a level which is affordable today and sustainable for the future.

UKIP Wales Leader Nathan Gill : “It’s clear to me that all this eleventh-hour grandstanding could and should have been done much sooner to have a real effect on the future of Welsh steel.  “Things that could be done with immediate affect are still not happening and should have happened months  if not years ago. George Osborne could scrap his Carbon Price Floor which levies £18 per tonne of CO2 compared to the EU’s levy of £4 per tonne  and instead return energy costs ideally to levels on a par with the EU average  if not below  although this would mean essentially defying Brussels.   It makes you realise quite how impotent the UK has become in running its own affairs and putting the interests of its own people first. 
‘Let’s celebrate the outbreak of democracy in this country  and let’s hope that it spreads like a rash across the rest of Europe ’ Nigel Farage told a crowd of Dutch anti-treaty campaigners two days before the Dutch referendum on the EU’s treaty with Ukraine.  ‘I’m not here to tell the Dutch how to vote. But obviously I’m aligned. Everyone knows this isn’t really about a trade deal  it’s about the empire expanding.’  Let s hope the Dutch vote No this week and we follow in their footsteps in June!

UK Independence Party (UKIP) Leader Nigel Farage writes for Breitbart London:  Despite my best efforts in the European Parliament to embarrass the Dutch Prime Minister  Mark Rutte  by pointing out to him that during the revolving six month Dutch presidency of the European Council there is a European Union (EU) referendum in his home country  no one seems to have noticed.   Many voters remember that in the summer of 2005  61 per cent voted against the European Constitution only to find their expressed wishes completely ignored with the re-branded Lisbon Treaty and no powers surrendered by the EU. As ever  despite the wishes of the people  EU integration continued as if nothing had happened.   So I went to visit and my first assignment of the day showed me what an impressive young entrepreneurial team has been built up by this group. They are seriously organised. They have a campaign battle bus. They have 3 000 activists. This for an organisation that is not even a political party is impressive indeed.

Today s Dutch referendum on the EU s expansionist agreement with Ukraine really is the people s referendum and it shows how the internet is taking back power from our Europhile elites says UKIP Leader Nigel Farage.   The Dutch Referendum wasn t triggered by politicians or political parties  but by a determined group of well-organised  highly-motivated individuals. The internet truly is the gamechanger of our time. A small collection of individuals with an idea can find thousands of other kindred spirits who join them in championing a cause. That develops  becoming tens of thousands and then allowing a message to reach out to millions.   Will you help to spread this message of saying No to the Europhile elites by liking and sharing this post?

“We are the independence party in Scotland ” said UKIP Leader Nigel Farage as he joined Scottish UKIP leader David Coburn at the launch of the UKIP Scotland Manifesto.  Nigel Farage added: “There’s a huge mythology about attitudes in Scotland - the view that is put out by Nicola Sturgeon - that you think everybody in Scotland thought the European Union was wonderful  that issues like open door immigration were a non-political issue in Scotland.  “Our job in UKIP is to blow apart those arguments.”

UKIP Defence Spokesman Mike Hookem MEP has welcomed the report from the EU border agency FRONTEX which admits that the migration crisis has made it easier for terrorists to enter the EU saying  the truth about our safety and security is more important than protecting the feelings of the political establishment.   It stands to reason that with no checks or penalties in place for those making false declarations there will be an increase in numbers of people who wish us harm making use of the migrant crisis to get into the EU and crossing its internal borders freely. 
UK taxpayers face £50bn bill after EU judges overrule our tax laws - exposing how multinationals use EU courts to claw back taxes. Responding UKIP s Steven Woolfe MEP said:  The ECJ is making a full frontal attack on UK tax sovereignty and a lunge for the pockets of British taxpayers. It s outrageous that an EU court can overturn a settled decision made by our parliament.   Only by leaving the EU can we take back control of our tax system and our national finances. 
UKIP Leader Nigel Farage:  I have never seen a time when UKIP activists  members and supporters have been more motivated and united in their quest to win this campaign.   UKIP will be a big player in this referendum and it will fulfil a crucial role. One of our successes in the last two years has been getting non-voters to turn out and vote UKIP. Given that this will be the turnout referendum  that is to say that the side that mobilises its voters will win  it is clear that our role may well prove decisive.   Will YOU be helping to get our country back? Let us know in the comments.

On a visit to Sutton  UKIP s London Mayoral candidate Peter Whittle announced that when the Mayor is responsible for making major planning decisions  UKIP will give Londoners the final say through binding referendums  if 5% of the local population petition for such a referendum within three months.  Peter Whittle said   One of my key priorities if elected Mayor is to actually give power back to those who it belongs to  the people. I want to put democracy back into the hands of local people when it comes to large and controversial developments.   Recent polling has shown in stark detail that Londoners increasingly feel powerless over their built environment. This is why UKIP s policy proposes binding referenda  held by local authorities  on any new large developments  if 5% of the local population petition for such a referendum within three months. This policy is a real transfer of power from the Mayor to the people and will help to protect the connection between Londoners and their city.

UKIP Deputy Leader Paul Nuttall MEP: Jeremy Corbyn s reversal today has shown that he no longer cares about those who craved someone that stood for something to fight for them.  It’s not just that his speech was rubbish  that any Eurosceptic could reverse all his arguments and say the things he said need improving could be done more easily if we leave. It is that he  of all current politicians  is the last person that should be seen to be changing his mind just to save his job.  Now he doesn t need the support of the little people  he’s dropped them. Now he needs the parliamentary party to keep him as leader  he is kissing their backsides.  This speech showed he may well still be a conviction politician  but his conviction has changed. Now it is one of self-preservation as a party leader  and not what’s best for the UK.
UKIP Leader Nigel Farage has just returned the government s booklet of EU lies to Number 10 along with UKIP s London Mayoral candidate Peter Whittle and UKIP Deputy Chairman Diane James MEP. Returning to sender!  At the same time Nigel has challenged the Prime Minister to a head-to-head debate to see if the claims in that booklet really stand up to public scrutiny. Like if you would like to see that!
Wales can do so much better. UKIP wants to make devolution work. The failing record under seventeen years of near-one party rule means we need a new Assembly and a fresh approach with UKIP standing for common sense.  We believe in Wales. We believe in a Wales that is part of a Britain that is independent and self-governing.  Find more about what we believe and stand for in the UKIP Wales Manifesto for this year s Welsh Assembly Elections which was launched today.
UKIP Leader Nigel Farage:  I visited Downing Street today  returning the government s pro-EU booklet to sender.   If David Cameron is confident of the outrageous claims made in his EU booklet  then I challenge him to debate me anytime  anywhere. 
He s Nigel Farage s sporting hero and he s backing Brexit.   Cricket legend Sir Ian Botham has called on Britain to stand proud by voting to leave the European Union – saying the 28-member bloc is a racket.  Will you be following Beefy s advice?
UKIP Deputy Leader Paul Nuttall MEP: “Leaving the European Union would not stop teams being able to take on top flight players from overseas. At the moment there are players coming to premiership from many countries that aren’t members of the EU  so why would it have any detrimental effect?  “Leaving the EU would also smooth the development path for home-grown players such as 18-year-old Manchester United newcomer Marcus Rashford. Rashford is only playing because of an injury crisis  but the problem with having so many EU players in the Premier League is that people like him usually wouldn’t be given a chance.  “The academies aren’t able to push players on to full-time contracts because they find it cheaper to recruit an established player from overseas.”
A message from UKIP Leader Nigel Farage:    I ll be speaking at a big cross-party GO Movement rally in Stoke-on-Trent tomorrow. Details below  do come along 
UKIP Leader Nigel Farage: “The EU is negotiating visa free access for all Turks  all 77 million. It is also proposing visa free travel with Ukraine and the real problem is that in theory  free travel means you can come to Europe for 90 days. But the reality is that a lot of people will disappear or when they get to Germany claim their rights of family reunion.   “The real problem isn’t people trying to get to Britain illegally  the real problem is that in a few short years all of the people that came will have German passports  Dutch or Belgium passports. And as you know an EU passport means unqualified travel to the UK.”
UKIP Leader Nigel Farage: “For the Chancellor to come out with the most astonishing scare story in economic terms I’ve ever heard is scarcely credible but it shows you how scared he is. For him to suggest that if we’re not governed by a bunch of old men in Brussels our economy will fall to pieces  I think it is virtually despicable.”  “Ultimately what the referendum is really all about is not whether you believe me or Osborne on being better off or worse off  it is who should be in charge  who should be in charge of our steel industry  who should be in charge of financial services  who should be in charge of our fishing industry? Should it be us  or should it be someone else and that is what  I think  this referendum will come down to.”

UKIP Mayoral candidate Peter Whittle:  The chronic housing shortage and the huge strain on our infrastructure in the capital are not being addressed by the other candidates and in this manifesto UKIP outlines the only real way to provide a credible solution - and that is dealing with the rise in immigration.    Only UKIP are advocating a  leave  vote in the upcoming European Union referendum as we know this is the only way we can regain control of our borders.

An EU armed forces is being set up by stealth with the merger of the German and Dutch armies and navies. The plan is for the two countries to create a nucleus of an EU armed forces to fulfil the long term goal spelt out by German defence minister last year of having an EU army.  UKIP Defence Spokesman Mike Hookem MEP:  The EU was supposed to be about corralling German military dominance in Europe. That aspiration has clearly died and just as Germany now politically dominates the EU  this latest move with the Dutch army shows that in time Germany wants to expand and control as much as it can militarily.   The EU is moving towards a common defence and foreign policy regime with an EU army as the goal. While Britain remains in the EU  we cannot escape being part of this dangerous setup.

Nigel Farage was on Sky News this morning talking about President Obama s intervention into the EU Referendum and said the President was driven by bigger considerations than just being anti-British.   There is a bigger motivation and that is  with this trip  and with what he has said  he has guaranteed his financial future. He has done the bidding of the giant American corporates who want Britain to stay in the EU.   Why? Because they want this Trans-Atlantic Trade and Investment Partnership deal done so that the big American corporates can buy up chunks of our public services  including the National health Service - that s a bigger motivation.   The issue here is that he is spouting a line  he is saying he doesn t think the UK should be an independent  sovereign democracy. 
UKIP Deputy Leader Paul Nuttall MEP: “I believe postal voting needs to return to its origins – allowing those who are genuinely infirm and housebound  or perhaps abroad serving in the armed forces  to have their say at the ballot box.  “What we have the moment  thanks to the Labour party for whom it serves best  is a system where anyone can demand to be allowed a postal vote rather than visit a polling station.   “This means that some households can have all their votes decided by one person  regardless of an individual’s own personal political persuasions.”
Peter Whittle  UKIP’s London Mayoral candidate  speaking in Sidcup where he joined local campaigners fighting to save Old Park Farm  one of Bexley s few open spaces from council supported development said   Due to the massive demand for house construction in London  planners are now making moves to build on our precious green belt areas  for example at Old Farm Park in Sidcup where I was this morning. This is simply unacceptable and will have a permanent detrimental effect on future generations of Londoners.   The only real way to protect the green belt is to make it illegal for local authorities to grant planning permission which leads to homes being built on it. The green belt is one of our nation s greatest national treasures and neither this nor future governments have the right to deprive be future generations of it. The answer is to make it impossible to build on green belt whilst incentivising brownfield and other non-contentious developments. 
Obama came to the UK to parrot David Cameron s lines on the EU. Ignore the global political class and vote to LEAVE on June 23rd.

UKIP s Deputy Leader and Hillsborough survivor Paul Nuttall MEP has released a statement on today s Hillsborough verdict:    All of us in Liverpool and across the country will be pleased with this result. For far too many years  27 long years  the questions have remained unanswered and no responsibility has been taken for the appalling events of that day.   Liverpool fans have been publicly traduced and blamed for their own suffering. The Police at the stadium have been found to be responsible for a whole series of failures that lead to the horrors of that day  a day burnt permanently in my  and thousands of other minds.   At last the process of justice can begin  and the process of healing can have a chance. I will never forget that day  nor will the city of Liverpool  but Justice will go some way to soften the pain. 
James Clapper  the US Director of National Intelligence  the principal intelligence adviser to the US President  has warned that open borders allow Isil sleeper cells into Europe and UK capable of carrying out Paris-style attacks.  He has said there is evidence of fanatics from Islamic State in Iraq and Levant in Britain  Germany and Italy secretly plotting outrages like those witnessed in France and Belgium.  Membership of the EU makes us less safe.
In the first of his weekly referendum articles in the Daily Express every Wednesday  UKIP Leader Nigel Farage looks at the devastating impact that EU open borders have had on Page Hall  Sheffield.  Over 800 Roma people have been moved into the area. The overall state of decline  the rising crime and the closure of local businesses has to be seen to be believed.
A new report has claimed that the Government has underestimated net migration from the EU to the UK by at least 250 000 over the last five years.  UKIP Migration Spokesman Steven Woolfe MEP:  The scale of EU immigration into this country is simply unsustainable. As a member of the EU we do not have any power to reduce the levels of migration from EU member states.

EU should set up US-style intelligence agency  says Jean-Claude Juncker’s think tank. Responding UKIP s Mike Hookem MEP said the fight against terror in the UK  is not going to be won by giving more powers to the EU.    To have police officers on the street who are not directly under the control of the directly elected British government is frankly frightening. The only people who should have powers of arrest in the UK are solely British law enforcers enacting our law  not Brussels law.   But what this also demonstrates is that no crisis is too severe  no disaster too great for the EU not to use it as a power grab. Be warned: if we don t vote for Brexit on June 23rd we are sending a signal that we support these new measures. There is no status quo: it s independence or more Europe. 
UKIP Party Chairman Steve Crowther: Vote UKIP on Thursday and lets start the process thats going to end with Independence Day on June 23rd.
Open door immigration isn t working. LIKE if you ll be voting UKIP on Thursday.
A new poll released now exclusively by Survation has made it clear that when it comes to the big set piece TV EU Referendum debates  Boris Johnson and Nigel Farage are the public s clear favourites to represent the Leave campaign.   UKIP Chairman Steve Crowther said   This polling shows that the public recognise the titanic efforts of Nigel Farage and UKIP in getting this referendum. Now the public want him to be one of the two representatives in the big Wembley debate. The idea that Nigel and UKIP would not be represented in that debate  despite receiving nearly 4 million votes last year  winning the European Elections in 2014  currently polling 20% and being the only party advocating the leave vote in this referendum would be ludicrous.   We are told that David Cameron thinks debating Nigel Farage would be a pushover.  This is funny as he has spent years avoiding any direct debate with Nigel. It is of course in Number 10 s interest to avoid any direct debate with the man who forced him against his will to give the people of this country as choice about who governs them .

Don’t for one second think that the UK will have an opt out on this issue  as David Cameron and the traditional parties have neither the political will nor clout in Europe to defend our armed forces from becoming one part of a far-reaching European military structure.”   “However  I find it totally duplicitous and cowardly that David Cameron and the EU don’t have the guts to tell the British people of their true intentions before the referendum on 23rd June. This is an issue that not only affects our way of life but the very core of UK sovereignty.

A message from UKIP Leader Nigel Farage:  UKIP had a fantastic set of elections  breaking through into the Welsh Assembly  London Assembly and we had Councillors elected right across the country.   We now turn to the EU referendum on June 23rd - we must do everything we can to ensure the Leave side wins and that we get our country out of the disastrous European Union. With your help  I think we might just do it.   Will you be campaigning alongside Nigel?
Read UKIP Leader Nigel Farage s response to the Prime Minister s latest scaremongering EU speech:     The anti-democratic EU  far from bringing countries together  has divided Europe. As they continue to drive through the failed Euro single currency project  it is the lives of ordinary citizens across Europe who suffer at the hands of the EU nationalists who refuse to contemplate anything than deeper  total and complete EU integration.   If we Remain in the EU we will be locked inside a failed project that is pushing towards closer fiscal  political and military union  no matter the pain and suffering it brings to the people of Europe.

UKIP Deputy Leader Paul Nuttall MEP commented on a survey  conducted by William Reed/HIM that has the hospitality industry lining up on the  Leave  campaign by 39% to 37% for  Remain :    It is clear that Pubs recognise that they would be better off out  they are a microcosm of this country. In them the great matters are discussed and they always have been. Be it the weather  sport or politics. As I have always said  every pub is a Parliament  a parliament of ordinary people  and there  it is clear that people believe that our country s future will be better served by leaving the EU.

Enjoying a cup of tea and a slice of toast for breakfast could become a lot tougher as the European Union is aiming to ban high-powered appliances such as toasters and kettles.

The truth about immigration numbers into the UK: We haven t got a clue!
As Nigel Farage says without UKIP there wouldn t even be a referendum. Of course we should be involved in the big EU referendum debates.
In a speech in the House of Lords hosted by UKIP s James Carver and Lord Pearson of Rannoch the Rt. Hon Winston Peters MP  a former Foreign Minister and Deputy Prime Minister of New Zealand  made it absolutely clear that a future out of the EU and trading with the world was something to be aspired to   Anyone who thinks that the economy of the nation that once created the largest empire in history will be suddenly laid to ruin upon leaving the EU is greatly mistaken  or having left will be friendless  doesn’t understand history or realise when push comes to shove how deep Commonwealth bonds are.    The British people stand on the cusp of an exciting future. It will not be easy to achieve that future.  But if there is one nation that can do it  it is the British .
 Just when you thought the government’s record on open door mass migration couldn’t get any more appalling  we’ve seen the bombshell news this week that the situation is even worse than we thought.   Either we stay in the EU and let this madness go on  or we leave the European Union  take back control and bring numbers down to sensible levels. That is the choice on the ballot paper on June 23rd.   Like if you agree with Nigel Farage and will be voting Leave to take back control of our borders.
Plans for a European Border and Coastguard are being held back until after the UK referendum on June 23rd for fears of bolstering the campaign to leave  UKIP can reveal.  The Regulation  which would allow the EU run organisation to enter the territory of a member state without permission if it feels there are grounds to do so has been quietly scheduled for initial voting in July.   UKIP Defence spokesman Mike Hookem MEP:  How can Mr Cameron and his colleagues support a move which would allow foreign border agencies to operate in British waters without the permission of the British government? It s treacherous. 
Daily Express columnist Leo McKinstry gives his opinion on who should debate the Prime Minister   The fact that we have this crucial vote on our future is down to one man  Nigel Farage. Without his long  heroic crusade for British freedom there is no chance that the EU referendum would be happening.   Farage is one of the finest political debaters in the country  as he proved in March 2014 when he comprehensively destroyed Nick Clegg in a pair of LBC debates about Europe. According to the post-debate polling analysis  voters overwhelmingly judged that Farage had  the more appealing personality  and the  better arguments.   Do you agree?
SHARE this video of Nigel Farage if you think that the EU has been bad for Britain and that we must control our borders.  Only by spreading the word will we vote to LEAVE the European Union on June 23rd.
Steven Woolfe MEP UKIP s Immigration spokesman has responded to a study by MigrationWatch UK which points out that in 2014/15  the cost to the Exchequer of immigration was £17 billion   Ultimately  the British taxpayer will be forced to pick up the bill for our reckless migration policy  as a member of the EU.   This report highlights a fundamental problem with the UK s migration policy in the EU  that only UKIP have been addressing. Some EU migrants make a net fiscal contribution  but this is offset by those who don t. Therefore the contribution made by some EU migrants is null and void. Whilst members of the EU  we do not have the ability to control the number of migrants coming into the UK  and until we do  we can not sufficiently plan and manage our future public services.

That’s why I’ll be soon be touring the country in a double-decker bus  taking to the streets  visiting the big towns and cities and speaking to as many people as possible.   While this is a serious debate and is the most important political decision of our lifetime  there is nothing wrong in having a bit of fun during the campaign. I hope to see some of you out there in the coming weeks.   Keep your eyes peeled for further announcements!
UKIP Deputy Leader Paul Nuttall MEP has poured cold water on today s Queen Speech as  a mixed bag and light on major announcements  clearly the Government s highest priority is pushing for a Remain vote in the impending EU Referendum .   It was revealing to examine what didn t made it into the list of Bills announced today  such as the previously much talked about but now dropped Sovereignty Bill. It being dropped from the Government s legislative agenda just goes to show really how much of a con job Cameron s  re-negotiation  has been.    There was a big fist of Tory MPs convinced to support Cameron s decision to support the  Remain  side by promises of a Sovereignty Bill  and they must now feel utterly betrayed by the man they re whipped into cheerleading.   Read the rest of what Paul made of it at the link below...

UKIP Defence spokesman Mike Hookem MEP:  Given the huge threat to the UK military which a vote to remain would result in because of the plans for an EU military it is vital that soldiers register to vote and get the facts about the EU.   Soldiers have been gagged from taking part in campaigning and having an input  unless Number 10 have asked them to sign something on behalf of Project Fear  and now many won t be able to vote.   This is a travesty for democracy: this is a once in lifetime vote and the future of our country depends on it. People who put their lives on the line for this country need to play a part in that decision.

UKIP Leader Nigel Farage:  Open borders with Turkey would be a total disaster for our country. With a population of 80 million  it would mean even more uncontrolled migration into the UK and would include a huge flow of unemployed people into Britain. Then there is the security risk. For the UK to have total open borders with a country sharing a land border with Syria  Iraq and Iran would be madness.    Don’t let anyone tell you that open borders with Turkey can’t or won’t happen if we vote to Remain in the EU. A deal is already being done to give Turks visa-free access and we know that the likes of David Cameron and Angela Merkel have been long-time supporters of Turkey’s bid for full EU membership.   The alternative to all of this is that we vote to Leave  take back control of our democracy and take back control of our borders.   Will you be taking Nigel s advice?
UKIP Deputy Leader Paul Nuttall MEP:  The truth is that the EU s Common Agricultural Policy - designed to prop up inefficient farmers on the continent - is the very reason why bills remain high in the UK. Research from both the Institute of Economic Affairs and the Business for Britain group have proved that to be the case.   In the UK  entirely because of EU policies  beef costs 35% more  turkey 22%  lamb 11%  wheat 15%  chicken 22%  and potatoes 10% - each one of those costs hitting every single family in Britain. On average a family in the UK would save £45 a month on their food bill if not for the wasteful EU policies that affect our food prices.

UKIP London Assembly member Peter Whittle has slammed the flying of the EU flag at City Hall:  I was amazed today to discover that one of the first acts of Sadiq Khan has been to order the flying of the EU flag from City Hall. He just couldn t wait to display where his true loyalties lie. It is extraordinary.   Luckily there is an opportunity to make sure that the EU flag is never flown outside City Hall again and that is a Leave vote in the forthcoming EU Referendum.   It is also extraordinary that the English flag has not been flying from City Hall. London is the capital of England and we know full well that the Scottish and Welsh flags fly from their capital city s. So why not England? Seems to me to be most inappropriate.

Watch Live - We Want Our Country Back: Bolton  SPEAKERS Nigel Farage MEP Kate Hoey MP Paul Nuttall MEP
Net migration to Britain has increased to the second highest level on record  official figures reveal. The figure - the difference between the number of people arriving and leaving - was estimated at 333 000 for the year ending December 2015. This was 10 000 higher than the level recorded in the year to September. Net migration of EU citizens was estimated at 184 000 - up compared to the previous year when it stood at 174 000  and the joint highest figure on record.  UKIP Leader Nigel Farage said   Mass immigration is still hopelessly out of control and set to get worse if we Remain inside the EU  going on with disastrous open borders. However  I don t believe these official figures and I m sure the real numbers are much higher.

 It is essential that a clear message is sent that no migrant arriving on our shores by boat is allowed leave to remain. The spectacle of boats crossing the channel must be avoided. If we do not make it absolutely clear  we are likely to find the English Channel becoming a mortuary as economic migrants take to its unpredictable waters in unseaworthy vessels.   We have all seen the horrors of the Mediterranean  with thousands crossing and hundreds dying  we cannot allow that to happen off the shores of Kent and Sussex. We could see a migrant crisis coming to the shores of UK if we remain in the European Union.   Do you agree with UKIP Leader Nigel Farage?

UKIP Leader Nigel Farage:  We must return the 18 Albanians that are currently in Dover or we will face our own summer migrant crisis.   The straits of Dover are not the Mediterranean with vicious tides and is one of the busiest commercial shipping lanes in the world. Unless we stop the boats from coming many people will die.   I also believe that it has been a huge error to cut back our coast guard services. We are an island and we must protect our borders. 
UKIP Deputy Chairman Diane James MEP: “What we have now is a Dad’s Army situation. This is 2016 and the UK cannot protect or defend its shores and coastline from this vast and lucrative business.  “This woefully inadequate and nowhere near enough to deal with the sheer number of migrants who are clearly trying to get to the UK.

Professor Catherine Barnard was presented as an impartial expert from Cambridge University when in fact she is a Jean Monnet Chair of EU law and as such has a strong vested interest in a remain vote.  “I am appalled by this blatantly biased item on the BBC’s flagship early evening news programme.

Nigel Farage : Why we must vote LEAVE in the EU referendum  We are just hours away from the opportunity of a lifetime: the opportunity to get our country out of the European Union and in doing so get our borders back  our democracy back and for us to embark upon an exciting future as an independent nation.   That’s what happens if we leave the European Union. We will exit a failed political union  one which is now a disaster zone. We see a migrant crisis utterly out of control. We see a eurozone crisis causing human misery on a shocking scale.
The school over-run. Last year  nearly 1 in 4 primary schools were full or oversubscribed. The EU has failed us all. We must take back control of our borders now.

So vote to leave the EU today  every vote counts!
Lets have peace  trade and honest friendship with Europe.   Lets believe in ourselves.  Lets make today Independence Day!

UKIP Leader Nigel Farage: Whether they like it or not the political establishment must accept the result of the referendum. The British people voted to take back control of our borders and our democracy.  LIKE if you agree
UKIP s Roger Helmer MEP writes:  Vote in favour of Brussels  and that’s the issue settled  in effect  forever.  Vote against  and you’ll have a second referendum straight away.  Keep voting till you get it right.  The anti-Brussels answer simply can’t be accepted.  We saw this in Denmark  and twice in Ireland  and it shows a massive contempt for democracy.   The great Constitutional question – to stay or to leave – was rightly put to the British people  and we have their answer.  Leave.  It is now the job of the government of the day  and of Parliament  to give effect to that decision in a timely and positive way.  It would be a constitutional outrage if parliament sought to frustrate the outcome of the referendum – for that is the sole objective of demands for a second referendum. 
UKIP Leader Nigel Farage: It would be nothing short of a betrayal if the result of Brexit was anything other than a border policy that brought down migration numbers significantly to alleviate these pressures on our infrastructure.   The British people had the guts to ignore the establishment’s ‘project fear’ because they wanted to see real change in our country. That must manifest itself in tangible  measurable migration reform that ends free movement and that sees Britain take back control of who can and cannot come to our country. That is after all what all of us on the Leave side promised to deliver. 
UKIP Leader Nigel Farage to the European Parliament:  When I first came here 17 years ago  you all laughed at me. Well  you re not laughing now .

Do you agree with Nigel Farage?   The EU referendum was the greatest democratic exercise of my lifetime. It delivered a decisive result that demanded change for our country.    The next person to lead our country must be someone who intends to help fulfil this country s potential as a self-governing nation  a global Britain with strong border controls and a clear  credible path ahead out of the EU. 
 Remember those who went before us and made great sacrifices for our freedom  - Nigel Farage

Statement from Nigel Farage
Speaking today in the European Parliament UKIP Deputy Leader Paul Nuttall MEP said: “The British people have spoken and threats and bullying are not the answer to the questions the UK leaving the European Union has thrown up.   “The UK and Europe are joined by geography  culture  history and trade and that will not change. Therefore it is imperative on so many levels that we are good  healthy trading neighbours.   “We owe it to the citizens of both the UK and Europe to conduct these negotiations in a grown up manner so we can get the best deal for everyone.”  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYjy2xQbXEE
UKIP Defence Spokesman Mike Hookem MEP has blasted former Labour Prime Minister Tony Blair for his determination in taking the UK into conflict against Iraq saying his legacy will  always be one of a man craving power and influence over caution  advice and common sense.    Blair s quest for personal prestige on the international stage  the failure of the intelligence community and the failure of MPs to properly research the UN s reasons for not backing military action led to the UK s Armed Forces being condemned to seven years of hell for which they were under equipped and not properly supported.

After all of the efforts expended  the Tory establishment with its media friends in tow have managed to hound Brexiteer Andrea Leadsom out of the race  and we’re now looking at a Brexit fudge. You only had to listen to Theresa May s  mealy mouthed statement on EU free movement to realise what’s coming. She didn’t say she’d end it  she said she’d control it.  All this talk of “Brexit means Brexit” means almost nothing. That’s why UKIP is needed now more than ever. And we want to encourage you to tell your eurosceptic friends  no matter which party they’ve previously voted for or been a member of  to come and join the People’s Army too. To make sure we get REAL Brexit. To make sure that Britain gets what Britain voted for.  So join UKIP today if you haven t already at www.ukip.org/join and share this post with as many people as you can. Together  we can make the real change we voted for happen.
UKIP s David Kurten AM wants to take down the EU flag outside City Hall  and with London being the capital city of England  replace it with the St George s Cross!
Nigel Farage:  A snap General Election would be good for UKIP  especially in the many Labour held seats in which we were placed second last year. I don t think there is a desire in the country to have such an election though.  “The government must now get on with its job and inspire confidence. Whilst I did not want Mrs May  a Remain supporter  to become Prime Minister she has now said  Brexit means Brexit .    To hold faith with over 17 million voters who opted for Leave she must trigger Article 50 at the earliest realistic opportunity. I hope she picks a strong negotiating team.  “UKIP will be watching like a hawk to ensure that there is no backsliding. 
Outgoing UKIP Leader Nigel Farage writes:  I will be watching closely to make sure this government is not blackmailed by Brussels. It is time for strong leadership and real vision for our country.    Unmentioned since the referendum is the key issue of our territorial waters and the fish stocks that swim within them.    It is going to take real courage to take back what is rightfully ours. In fisheries terms we want to be like Norway  Iceland and the Faroes. We want our own exclusive 200-mile zone. 
A new report by the Commons Public Accounts Committee has found that the Ministry of Defence and its contractor Carillion Amey are  badly letting down service families . Responding UKIP Defence Spokesman Mike Hookem MEP has blasted the Ministry of Defence  saying “it is time to end the government sanctioned culture of housing our heroes in sties.”  “From speaking to military families up and down the country  I know the appalling conditions many of these brave people are forced to live in and the demoralising effect this has.”  “It is a disgrace that the MoD is willing to add further stress and worry to families already coping with loved ones being on operations.”

UKIP Defence Spokesman Mike Hookem Mep: “In a world with a rapidly changing security situation  that now includes the potential for both state and non-state actors to access nuclear material  it is crucial that we continue to have a nuclear option available as part of our overall national defence strategy.”
Margot Parker responds to #faceherfuture campaign launch:    When it comes to equal pay for equal work  which is an important issue which still needs fixing in the UK  the EU is neither the originator nor guarantor of any solutions. Within the EU institutions themselves  where one would expect to see this as a non-existent issue  women on average earn 16 per cent less than their male counterparts. No one is denying the need for us to fix this in the UK  but we do not need the EU to tell us how to do it. 
UKIP calls for Hezbollah to be banned after al-Quds Day Parade:  “The number one duty of the Mayor is to ensure that Londoners are safe.

I hope that on reflection that he will change his mind.”

UKIP s Peter Whittle AM :  A Bridge that will require public support to maintain but will be closed off for private functions and prevents certain sized groups from crossing and in addition will cost astronomical sums to construct is not something that I can support so I am pleased that the Transport Secretary is considering the Government s ongoing support for this white elephant project.   I call upon Chris Grayling and in addition London s Mayor Sadiq Khan to lay this project to rest and refocus efforts on creating a more worthwhile crossing in East London.

Reacting to news that the Supreme Court has over-turned the Named Person Act  UKIP Scotland Leader David Coburn MEP said: “I am the only Scottish politician that has objected to this draconian  interfering  we-know-best piece of legislation and I am delighted the court has sided with the decent parents in Scotland.  “While the public were outraged angry and worried by the proposals  the tories repeatedly abstained  offering their voters no voice whatsoever on this most damaging legislation.  “This is a major victory for UKIP in Scotland  and it will be a huge relief to concerned parents across Scotland that the Supreme Court agrees with us and has sided with the people against the nanny state government headed by the SNP.

UKIP London Assembly Leader Peter Whittle AM: “Sadiq Khan has said he wants to be a mayor  for all Londoners  but instead he has lined up with the whining Remainers and risks holding London back from enjoying the huge opportunities now open to the UK.  In insisting on a brand of London exceptionalism he risks cutting it off from the rest of the country at a time when the capital needs to become more integrated  not less. London is a great and global city  but it needs to be lead by somebody who embraces change and opportunity  rather than hide behind fear and inertia. 
Thank you Nigel Farage and thank you all for voting to leave the EU.  In the coming weeks  months  and years UKIP will ensure that Brexit means Brexit.
UKIP London AM David Kurten comments on the decision to introduce English written tests for Private Hire Vehicle drivers like those who work for Uber:  It is important for both safety and communication that all PHV and Taxi drivers can speak good English. All migrants to the United Kingdom who wish to work in service industries should have a high level of English and a good appreciation and respect for British culture and practices. PHV drivers are no exception to this and to provide a good level of service they should be able to prove that they can communicate effectively in English. 
 Brexit must mean proper border controls and out of the single market. Anything less would be a complete betrayal.  - Nigel Farage  Brexit must mean Brexit!
Nigel Farage:  I m starting to detect a lot of frustration out there from the 17.4 million who voted Leave. Government need to get on with it and deliver Brexit.   That must mean an end to free movement  out of the single market & taking back our territorial waters. Anything less would be betrayal.   LIKE if you agree with Nigel
Nigel Farage out campaigning at the weekend to make sure Brexit means Brexit!
The number of people claiming jobseeker s allowance fell in July following the Leave vote in the referendum.  The Remain moaners and the doom-mongers wrong yet again!
UKIP Thanet Council Leader Chris Wells said:  In a post-Brexit world  the media has asked what is the purpose of UKIP? And on the doorsteps the voters of Northwood have given their answer.   It is to make sure the Tory government genuinely pursues Brexit. It is to ensure locally we never sink to the toxic and dysfunctional chaos of Labour administration again. It is to have a council which residents can feel proud to have act on its behalf. All the things Tory and Labour Councils have previously failed to achieve here in Thanet.   We will resume work to right the financial and reputational wrongs inherited from previous administrations and we will  day by day  continue to honour the trust voters have renewed in us this day. 
UKIP MEP and equestrian Jane Collins has hit out at Brussels for erasing the achievements of Britain s sporting heroes  including Laura Trott and Mo Farah:  Where was the EU in the early hours of the morning when our amazing athletes were training?   It was UK National Lottery money which helped them develop into the world class athletes who have made this country proud.    I know from my time with the equestrian world it has very little time for the EU. The only way the EU would win in a race is if there was a big pot of taxpayers  cash at the finish line. 
Jean-Claude Juncker  president of the European Commission  has claimed that national borders were “the worst invention ever”.  UKIP s Peter Whittle AM:  Mr Juncker s comments are beyond parody and another reason why we must exit the EU as quickly as possible  otherwise our security could be left exposed by Juncker’s anti-borders policy.   “Safe and secure borders help to define a nation  you only have to look at Germany to see what happens when you when you effectively discard them. 
As Nigel Farage says the establishment is out of touch on big foreign aid spending. The budget should be cut and the British people put first.
Mike Hookem MEP:  This small drop is nowhere near the reduction to the tens of thousands promised by the Tories.   Theresa May needs to enact Article 50 quickly so we can have a points-based system brought in.   We must also also invest in the border force to end the illegal immigration into this country. 
The triggering of Article 50 to Leave the EU should not be delayed beyond January - Nigel Farage

Nigel Farage: “What this judgement from the European Commission shows is simply this: if you’re a member of the European Union  you’re not in charge of your own life.  “What retrospective taxation like this does is it puts off investors from putting money anywhere in Europe. So for post-Brexit Britain  it’s very good indeed.  “I think a post-Brexit Britain should have a very competitive corporation tax rate  and be encouraging as many companies as possible to headquarter in our country. I want a simplification of all taxation within the UK and I think that would lead to huge benefits.”

 There is already huge anxiety out there in the country regarding Theresa May s reluctance to trigger Article 50. Her rejection of the type of migration system so many went out there and voted Leave to see implemented indicates serious backsliding.   Those of us on the Leave side were perfectly clear in campaigning for strong border controls outside of the EU. The people were clear in wanting a points-based immigration system which is why so many went out and voted to Leave the European Union. Any watering down from that will lead to real anger.   If the establishment think they can stitch-up Brexit then they better be ready for the huge electoral consequences from a British public who on June 23rd voted for radical political change and now expect it to be delivered without failure.

UKIP Leader Nigel Farage:  Guy Verhofstadt hates everything we stand for which should mean a much shorter renegotiation.   Mr. Verhofstadt is a fanatical supporter of EU federalism even by the standards of the European Parliament.   This appointment will no doubt speed up the UK s exit from the European Union. 
Responding to Theresa May’s speech on education today  Nigel Farage said:  The Government is now supporting the creation of new grammar schools; yet another flagship UKIP policy goes mainstream.   We in UKIP have campaigned for a return to selective education and at times it has felt a lonely place  but today s announcement is great news. Grammar schools work and help the poorest in our society get on in life. I am delighted by what I ve heard from the Prime Minister. I hope that MPs in Mrs. May s party now have the courage to support this push for new grammar schools. 
Nigel Farage will be taking your calls on LBC from 10am to midday tomorrow. Tune in and get involved!
The European Parliament need to rethink its appointment of Verhofstadt as Brexit negotiator says UKIP s Outgoing Deputy Leader Paul Nuttall MEP.
Today in the annual ‘State of the Union’ debate in the Strasbourg parliament chamber UKIP’s Nigel Farage labelled Guy Verhofstadt’s appointment as chief Brexit negotiator for the European Parliament “pretty much an act of war on any sensible negotiating process.”   If you think of this building as a temple  well Mr Verhofstadt is the high priest. A fanatic  in fact there is only one real nationalist in the room and it’s you because you want flags  anthems and armies. I would argue what we really need is to have a sensible  common sense approach and for this parliament to recognise it has made a mistake and to find somebody who actually likes the United Kingdom to lead these talks.   This is a must watch! Make sure you like and share!

Only by voting UKIP will we ensure Brexit really means Brexit and 17.4m people get what they voted for in the referendum.
UKIP Leader Diane James MEP comments on the re-election of Jeremy Corbyn and invites the millions of decent  patriotic Labour voters who simply don t recognise this narrow  metropolitan far-left Labour Party to join the common sense ranks of UKIP to help us deliver and win for Britain.
Former Soldier and Oxford College porter Dickie Bird has been selected to fight the Witney Constituency vacated by David Cameron -  I’m excited to have the opportunity to fight this seat on behalf of UKIP and local residents. I live in  and love  Oxfordshire. For twenty years I served in the army as part of Oxfordshire s  local Regiment  The Royal Green Jackets  now called The Rifles.   However  on leaving  I found the local Council very unhelpful. This made me realise that in order to change things for people it is no good railing at the radio and TV and sitting back  instead I felt that I had to get involved and do something to make things better. We need to do more to look after all those who have lived and paid tax here for years.   I joined UKIP in 2009 and was a candidate for them soon after  they are the only Party standing up for our Country and fully behind all those who voted for Brexit.”
 During the European Election campaign in 2014 and this year’s referendum campaign  we were repeatedly told by the Remain campaign that there was no reason to fear an EU Army. Perhaps some of those people who publicly stated that leave campaigners like myself who raised the issue of ever creeping collaboration on defence at an EU were ‘scaremongering’ should have been in the European Parliament on Monday  where there was no holding back on the EU’s aims for its own defence force.  - Mike Hookem MEP
Cllr Tim Aker MEP:  Today has confirmed that Jeremy Corbyn s Labour Party has nothing to offer the millions of decent patriotic Labour supporters who voted Leave and want to see levels of migration brought down. Several times Corbyn spoke about trust  but how can the voters ever trust Labour again when millions voted on June 23rd for control of their borders  yet Labour are determined to keep free the movement of people?   Many Labour MPs should be worried. The patriotic working class are leaving them in droves to UKIP and Jeremy Corbyn s leadership will swell the ranks of UKIP as we grow and offer a genuine alternative to those who are worried about cuts to vital services  over development and Tory flip-flopping on Brexit. 
David Kurten AM:  The Labour party has again shown how utterly out of touch it is with the ordinary people of this nation. It is three months since the referendum and Shadow Health Secretary Diane Abbott is still attempting to smear the 17.4 million Brexit voters as ‘racist and stupid’. Perhaps it is her who is less than intelligent for not understanding that ordinary people voted for Brexit simply because they want Britain to have control over her borders and laws  including many voters from ethnic backgrounds. 
Steven Woolfe MEP will be on Question Time tonight - spread the word and make sure you tune in!
UKIP Leader Diane James:  I’m not angry at the PM for pinching our policies. They’re good policies  and they’ll be good for the British people  whoever brings them in. My worry is that she won’t deliver them. So to voters who look at the Tories now and  seeing them disguised in UKIP purple  are tempted to give them another chance  I would say simply this: You can’t beat the real McCoy.   Now more than ever  the country needs UKIP to hold the Government s feet to the fire. Goodness knows the official opposition can’t: they don’t actually want to leave the EU  or cut immigration  or revive a school system which provided opportunity to all on the basis of merit  not money. So don’t let Magpie May distract you with a few stolen ideas. Back UKIP for a strong  credible opposition which will hold her to her promises. 
WATCH: Steven Woolfe MEP on BBC Question Time last night
To mark 100 days since the EU Referendum UKIP s Leader in the London Assembly Peter Whittle AM has produced a list of 100 reasons to be cheerful.    Peter Whittle said  “Some of the entries on my list are more light-hearted than others but they are all above all reasons to be cheerful post the historic Brexit vote.   The list shows the full extent of the lies of Project Fear. It also shows how the British people knew their own minds and weren t going to be intimidated by vested interests masquerading as experts. 
UKIP MEP Steven Woolfe MEP has responded to Theresa May s Brexit speech:  We welcome her clear decision to repeal the 1972 Act  that Article 50 negotiations are to be launched by March 2017 and that Remainers will have to accept the people s referendum decision. UKIP campaigning position is again vindicated and replicated.   The bare bones of  Brexit means Brexit  now have a time frame. Good. But with a parliamentary party divided  an opposition in flux and the House of Lords implacably opposed  it is up to UKIP to keep up the electoral pressure on. Nobody else will. We have shown our political campaigning power brings results on democracy  education and taxation. We will continue to do just that and ensure the political elite never leave anyone behind or become complacent again.

Responding to comments from the University Minister Jo Johnson  suggesting that it was the ignorant and uneducated that voted for Brexit and therefore more should be siphoned through university  former teacher and UKIP member of the London Assembly David Kurten said:  I am sure Mr Johnson would think that anyone who didn t go to Eton like his friends and fellow Remainers are uneducated.  “However  there are millions of people in this country who didn t benefit from a feather bedded education as he did who are just as informed and wise as he is. How would he explain that his brother the Foreign Secretary an Old Etonian and an Oxford man decided that the wisest move policy is to be in control of your own destiny.

Party Chairman Paul Oakden: UKIP will now move forward and in a calm and considered way choose our next leader.
Nigel Farage writes   It is vital for the 17.4 million Brexit voters that we have a strong UKIP voice to challenge the Government throughout this journey to our nation’s independence outside of the EU. If by the time of the next election we do not have our British passports back and have not reclaimed our territorial fishing waters  then the June 2016 referendum will be unfinished business.   UKIP will be fit for purpose and provide the genuine voice of political opposition. All political parties have bad days. I’m pleased that yesterday is behind us. 
Speaking from the hospital in Strasbourg  UKIP MEP Steven Woolfe MEP said:  The CT scan has shown that there is no blood clot in the brain. At the moment I am feeling brighter  happier  and smiling as ever. As a precaution  I am being kept in overnight awaiting secondary tests to make sure everything in fine.   I would like everyone to know that the parliamentary staff  the UKIP MEPs with me and hospital staff have been brilliant. Their care has been exceptional. I am sitting up  and said to be looking well. The only consequence at the moment is a bit of numbness on the left hand side of my face.   --- From everyone at UKIP  thank you for the messages of concern and good will. We are glad that Steven is well.
UKIP Transport Spokesman Jill Seymour MEP: “Today’s news is a huge disappointment. I had hoped that Prime Minister Theresa May was going to see sense  and either scrap HS2 altogether  or at the very least seek a cheaper alternative. But it is clear that the Government remains hell-bent on throwing billions of pounds at HS2  when it would be much wiser to concentrate on improving our ageing nationwide infrastructure. The HS2 line will tear up large parts of our countryside  and wreck the lives of people in many rural communities. It will benefit only a small minority of travellers  yet all British taxpayers will have to foot the bill.”   I have yet to see a convincing economic case made for HS2  and the reason for this is that it simply doesn’t exist. Even before a track has been laid  this white elephant has cost nearly £1.5 billion. 
The European Union s Court of Auditors has failed to give the accounts a clean bill of health for the 22nd year in a row. The report blasts the payments underlying the accounts as being  materially affected by error   leading the Court to issue an adverse opinion on the legality and regularity of the payments underlying the accounts. An adverse opinion is rare in accountancy  and is issued only in serious cases where there has been a substantial departure from generally accepted accounting principles.  Jonathan Arnott MEP:  It s a good thing that the British people voted to leave the European Union when we did because the levels of waste and bureaucracy are absolutely breath-taking. That s the nature of a system that simply isn t fit for purpose.   These examples of waste would make you think the EU is being run by  Count Von Count  from Sesame Street. Taxpayers  money is being wasted left  right and centre  the EU has obviously lost control of the money tap. I am sure that when we re outside the EU we can cut waste  when we can cut out the middleman and look after our own businesses ourselves. 
Paul Nuttall MEP: “It is disgraceful that hospital trusts continue to hike up the costs of hospital car parking. Hospital parking charges hit people when they are typically at their most stressed and anxious. Going to hospital as a patient or visitor is a stressful enough thing at the best of times. But when car parks are run as revenue maximising assets rather than as a facility for people it adds significantly to the stress.  “We in UKIP have for many years opposed hospital car parking charges as we regard them as little more than a tax on the sick and the vulnerable. In our general election manifesto we pledged to invest £200 million from savings made from tackling health tourism to make parking at English hospitals free for patients and their visitors. Given that Theresa May and the Conservative seem to be spending their time lifting policies from our manifesto can I suggest that they take a look at this one next.”
Anyone else had enough of Labour s hypocrisy over selective education asks Paul Nuttall MEP
UKIP s Jane Collins MEP said the children “looked very mature for their age” and “hoped the British public weren’t providing refuge for adult economic migrants trying to pull a fast one.”  “I have been told by social workers there are many cases of transparently adult migrants claiming to be under 16 and the social work teams have to go on what these ‘children’ say unless it can be proved otherwise with full access to the social security system here in the UK.  “Many of the migrants in Calais threw away their documentation because then they are unable  under international law  to be returned to a country if they are technically ‘stateless’ or it cannot be proved where they came from. In my constituency in Rotherham we have clear need of funds and qualified workers in the local council to stop the abuse of children which many say is still ongoing. Why should children in Yorkshire suffer for people who may well be fooling the system?”
People in the borough of Barking and Dagenham now face a 50-year wait for a council house  a senior Councillor from the ruling Labour Group has said in a forthcoming BBC documentary.  Peter Harris  UKIP s Chairman in Barking and Dagenham   This Labour Council should be charged with criminal neglect. Even with the knowledge of the chronic shortage of Social Housing  their current house building plans simply fail to address this situation. The programme s findings are no surprise to me or thousands of local residents. The chronic housing situation here is abysmal and is as a direct result of decades of failed policies from both Conservative and Labour Governments.   David Kurten AM  who speaks on housing for UKIP in the London Assembly added  “Successive governments and Mayors have all promised to build more homes  but have not delivered. The reality is that waiting lists for council homes will continue to increase until Britain gets immigration under control and brings down demand for new homes  so that the private rented sector returns to some kind of sanity  and everyday people can afford to rent homes normally.”

UKIP Transport Spokesman Jill Seymour MEP:  Whatever people’s views about the expansion of Heathrow  it’s vital now that the Government cracks on with delivering what we seem to have been talking about for years.  Other countries have built entire new airports while the UK Government has been pontificating about what to do over the Heathrow third runway issue. It’s been a case of too much talk  and not enough action.    I feel for the people living around the Heathrow area  who have been watching and waiting for nearly 20 years now  uncertain about what the future holds for them. To make them wait another year before this comes to Parliament is a complete dereliction of care towards all of those whose lives are being impacted.   No  UKIP doesn t support Heathrow  but like a Remain supporter after the referendum  we accept the decision and demand that the Government get on with it. 
Today Nigel Farage confronted the British and European establishment that is stalling on Brexit. He said the that the British Referendum is something they cannot ignore and that it is in everyone’s mutual interest to get on with it and secure a sensible  tariff-free trade deal.  “Frankly the whole thing is a disgrace and it’s even worse that it is supported by quislings in the British parliament  people like Nick Clegg and Ed Miliband  who are desperate to keep Britain inside this awful Single Market. Well I’m sorry but it simply isn’t going to happen. If you think by delaying Brexit  if you think by stopping Brexit  you are going to help your own businesses  your own industries  you’re wrong. It is in the mutual interest of all of us to get on with this and conclude a sensible  straight-forward  tariff-free deal.”
UKIP s North East MEP Jonathan Arnott MEP   I am absolutely delighted that these jobs have been secured and this is fantastic news not just for Nissan workers  but also for those working in jobs in the supply chain. This is a real much needed boost to the local economy.   I wonder how long it will be before we hear the words  despite Brexit  from those naysayers and doom-mongers who downplay every success and magnify every failure in an attempt to sabotage the will of the people and British prosperity. They were not slow to try to weaponise Nissan in their fight against the referendum result and this is one in the eye for them. They ought to reflect upon the jeopardy in which they place British jobs when they do so. 
On Tuesday 25th October Zac Goldsmith MP announced that he was resigning as the Conservative MP for Richmond Park  in light of the Government s announcement on a third runway at Heathrow.  Zac Goldsmith has resigned on a matter of principle and UKIP admire him for having the courage to do so. UKIP have always believed that Gatwick was a preferred option to Heathrow. Recognising Zac as a principled man  who was fully committed to helping get Britain out of the European Union  UKIP Leader Nigel Farage  in conjunction with our National Executive Committee have agreed that we will not be fielding a candidate in the upcoming by-election for Richmond Park.  The Liberal Democrats are committed to overturning the result of the 2016 Referendum and ignoring the will of the British people. This must not be allowed to happen. UKIP are encouraging all of our supporters and voters to support Zac Goldsmith in his bid to become an independent MP.
As Tim Aker MEP says the so called experts and lecturers sneer at the working classes across Europe. They did it in the referendum and are still doing it now. It s about time they went back to school!
UKIP Party Chairman Paul Oakden   With the deadline for the submission of leadership applications now passed  I can now confirm who will have their name included on the ballot of members to be the new Party Leader. Four candidates completed and submitted application forms  along with the requisite deposit before the 12 noon deadline. These applications have now been checked and approved by Piers Wauchope  Returning Officer for this election.   The UKIP leadership candidates are EVANS  Suzanne NUTTALL  Paul REES-EVANS  John WHITTLE  Peter   I m pleased to confirm that there were no late  or rejected applications.

UKIP s Jonathan Arnott MEP  a member of the EU Budget committee  said:   For this individual to be paid this staggering amount of money and then be explicitly asked to do nothing flies in the face of hard-working Brits who do a hard day s work for their money.   To pay them more than the prime minister to do nothing seems rotten but then getting value for British taxpayers  money has never been a high priority for the EU  which is a bonfire of taxpayers  hard-earned cash.

UKIP Defence Spokesman Mike Hookem MEP:  The wearing of poppies is not a political statement nor is it glorifying war.   It is an act of remembrance of those who gave their lives  including the 15 professional and top level footballers who were killed in World War II. They did so in order to secure freedom and liberty including the right for players to play football and fans to support in peace.   I hope the FA treat this FIFA ruling with the contempt it deserves and our players proudly wear the poppy on their shirts and fans wear their poppies with pride. 
Make sure you tune into the Alliance for Direct Democracy in Europe - ADDE s Declaration for a really democratic Europe  that reflects its citizens’ will on Friday at 2.30pm!
Following the High Court decision calling for a Parliamentary vote on the triggering of Article 50  Nigel Farage said    I worry that a betrayal may be near at hand. Last night at the Spectator Parliamentary Awards I had a distinct feeling that our political class  who were out in force  do not accept the 23rd of June Referendum result.    I now fear that every attempt will be made to block or delay the triggering of Article 50. If this is so  they have no idea of the level of public anger they will provoke. 
UKIP s Gerard Batten MEP   Today s judgement by the High Court is a political decision by part of the establishment that wants to thwart the will of the British people in the Referendum.  “All previous treaties have been entered into and signed by British governments using the Royal Prerogative without a vote in Parliament first. Only when parts are incorporated into law by Act of Parliament does Parliament become involved  and the courts have jurisdiction over their application. Triggering Article 50 may indeed inevitably affect domestic law but until it does the courts have no jurisdiction.  “The Supreme Court meets on 7th December to confirm or set aside this decision.  If they confirm it they will be setting themselves against the democratic will of the electorate and will precipitate a constitutional crisis.  The outcome of which cannot be foreseen.”
Nigel Farage:  It was perfectly clear what people were voting for: to leave the single market  for strong border controls and to take back control of areas such as our fishing waters. Yet rather than accept the verdict of the biggest democratic exercise of our lifetimes  the establishment wants to stop proper Brexit being delivered. It shows why once again a strong UKIP is absolutely vital.   Our political system has led to an out-of-touch political class so arrogant that they do not feel bound by the outcome of our historic referendum. It is quite clear to me that if we do not see the Brexit that 17.4 million voted for  the political change we have seen so far may only be the start. 
Brexit betrayal will lead to political anger says Nigel Farage.  Like if you agree.

Commenting on Donald J. Trump  being elected the next President of the United States  Nigel Farage said  Today  the establishment is in deep shock. Even more so than after Brexit. What we are witnessing is the end of a period of big business and big politics controlling our lives.   Voters across the Western world want nation state democracy  proper border controls and to be in charge of their own lives.   I commend Donald Trump for the courage with which he has fought this campaign and I look forward to a closer relationship between the USA and the UK. We now have a President who likes our country and understands our post-Brexit values.   Prepare for further political shocks in the years to come.

Jill Seymour MEP: “There has never been a convincing business case made for HS2  so it is no surprise that support for this white elephant of a project is at an all-time low. People have had enough of the Government’s spin and hype  and can see the cost of this vanity project spiralling almost by the week. Who knows how eye-wateringly high the final cost will be?  “HS2 is an ill-conceived and fundamentally flawed design.  “The project is highly controversial because of HS2 Ltd’s failure to evaluate cheaper and better alternatives  its exorbitant cost  insufficient new capacity  poor connectivity  and demolition of 500-plus homes.”
Tim Aker MEP:  Last week I was interviewed on EU plans to give Brits voluntary EU citizenship. Daft plan  but one way to get rid of the Remoaners. They don t accept the result and will do all they can to drag us back into the EU. 
Nigel Farage: “We had Remain voters protesting in the streets of London  Remoaners as we call them  and I have a feeling they are the very same people that were flown to New York to protest outside the Trump Tower the other day.  “We were told terrible things would happen to us and actually  unemployment is coming down  growth is going up  new housebuilding is at near record levels manufacturing figures are good  the stock market is relatively strong.  “That is reward enough for me.”
An EU military could end up costing British tax payers millions of pounds despite the historic vote to leave the EU  UKIP s Mike Hookem MEP has warned.  Reports being voted on in the European Parliament this week demand up to half a billion pounds per year for one area of the EU Defence Union alone  with €90 million for  preparatory action on EU defence research  starting in 2017.  The timeline of progress in the development of the EU Military  which British officials have long denied would happen despite evidence to the contrary  would mean the UK could not only contribute financially but could be legally drawn into it as the government will not have tabled a vote on Brexit as demanded by the high court let alone invoked Article 50 by the time the EU strategy kicks into action.
Nigel Farage:  I have said since the now famous photograph with Donald Trump ten days ago that I would do anything to help our national interest and to help cement ties with the incoming Anglophile administration.   At every stage I am greeted by negative comments coming out of Downing Street. The dislike of me  UKIP  and the referendum result is more important to them than what could be good for our country.   I have known several of the Trump team for years and I am in a good position with the President-elect’s support to help. The world has changed and its time that Downing Street did too.   Agree? Share!

Following the Chancellor of the Exchequer’s Autumn Statement today  Mark Reckless said   Despite the fearsome predictions of Remain supporters  the overall prognosis for the economy is good  as we knew it would be. The official forecast is that unemployment in 2020 after we have left the EU will be just 860 000. This administers the last rites to the infamous claim that 3 million jobs would be lost if we left the EU.   Every month the Government delays Brexit costs the exchequer over a billion pounds. UKIP says just get on with it.

UKIP -  New Leadership Announcement
Paul Nuttall MEP has been elected as leader of #UKIP
John Bickley   I’m delighted that Paul Nuttall MEP has asked me to take responsibility for this hugely important role. I have seen with my own eyes the devastating impact of uncontrolled unskilled immigration on our communities. UKIP is  was and will be in favour of immigration but it must be immigration on the UK’s terms.   Everyone in the world must feel there is a level playing field when it comes to coming to the UK. It doesn’t matter what your faith  ethnicity  nationality  gender  sexual orientation or any other aspect  what matters is what people can offer and what the country needs.   However  under Labour and latterly the Conservatives our immigration system has discriminated against the world  and especially the Commonwealth  to favour low skilled immigration from the European Union  this must end. 
UKIP Founding Member Gerard Batten has been announced by Paul Nuttall MEP as the Party s Spokesman on Brexit:  In this role I will describe how Britain can and must leave the European Union as quickly and cleanly as possible. I want UKIP to stop talking about Brexit and to start talking about Exit! We don t want a  hard  or  soft  Brexit but a democratic and speedy exit. The result of the Referendum must be respected and enacted without delay.   Theresa May and her Tory Government cannot be trusted to deliver our withdrawal from the EU. She was a Remainer who heads a predominantly Remain government. Mrs May s strategy is to delay and delay the whole process in order to fudge it and to try and foist on us a  Norwegian or Swiss  type EU model whereby we continue to pay money to the EU  obey a large percentage of its laws  and have open borders. In which case we would not have left the European Union at all.   UKIP s policy will be to reject Article 50. Rather  we will call for Parliament to repeal the European Communities Act (1972) immediately as the first step in the process: this will restore law-making supremacy to the UK Parliament and put the British Government in the driving seat of negotiations not the EU. 
David Kurten AM said   I am delighted to have been appointed as UKIP s Education and Apprenticeships Spokesman. 15 years in teaching and now a member of the London Assembly s Education Panel means I will be able to bring my experience  both practical and political to the role.   I am looking forward to developing our education policy which will ensure that there will be a diversity of education options for all pupils and students of all ages and abilities. This means a mixture a grammar  technical  specialist and comprehensive schools in all areas of the country  and further investment and development of apprenticeships to bridge the skills gap so that British young people have the skills needed to make the most of every opportunity.   I want to see an education system where not only will no child be left behind  but no child will be held back.
The new UKIP leader  Paul Nuttall MEP   is a “game changer” for Labour and could realistically oust a string of MPs in the north of England  Frank Field  the Labour former minister  has said.  Field  the MP for Birkenhead and chair of the House of Commons work and pensions committee  said Labour needed an urgent strategy to deal with Nuttall’s succession to the UKIP leadership  as he will appear to many voters as a man who is “on the right page at the right time”.
UKIP Leader Paul Nuttall said   Today s migration figures just go to show that you can t trust the Tories to bring down immigration.   This is an abject failure not just by the Government in general but by the Prime Minister in particular.   After six and a half years of Tory rule  we still have net migration running at more than 300 000. Another city the size of Hull added to our population. More pressure on housing  schools and the NHS.   The PM is called Theresa May. Sometimes I wonder if she has a secret twin called Theresa May Not. Because she never seems to deliver - on immigration  on Brexit or on anything .
UKIP Brexit Spokesman Gerard Batten MEP has some choice words for the Brexit Secretary David Davis:  David Davis is already going weak at the knees. It is ridiculous to offer to pay to trade with the EU.  Every country in the world has access to the Single Market.     We should take the initiative and offer the EU the choice: do they want continued tariff-free trade with the UK  or do they wish to trade under WTO rules and impose the Common External Tariffs on us?     The latter would impact far more on them than it would on us  and it would not be in their interests.    The Government needs to start showing some resolution and guts in dealing with Brexit. Brexit must mean exit!

UKIP Leader Paul Nuttall MEP has issued a direct electoral threat to any MP who attempts to defy the will of the people and vote against Brexit.   It is a disgrace if any MP tries to play around with the will of the people.  “We will go into those constituencies and campaign hard to remove those MPs.”
UKIP Education Spokesman David Kurten AM said   The Casey Report published today shows how successive governments have failed our country  and how rapid  mass immigration is leading to a breakdown in society. It is simple common sense that immigrants need many years to integrate into British society and culture.   Many of the report’s recommendations are things which UKIP has been saying for years. All schoolchildren should learn English  and have a proper understanding of British history and culture  whatever background they are from.   It is tolerance of certain different beliefs and practices which have led to turning a blind eye to FGM  child bride rapes and honour killings  not to mention challenging the lack of English language capability among specific groups such as Somali girls  and continued segregation in schools. These things should not be tolerated. Migrants must integrate into British culture and learn English properly. This is as important in schools and colleges as it is in wider society. 
Gerard Batten MEP   The anti-Brexit majority in the Commons is clearly planning to use the drawn out Article 50 process to hijack Brexit. That is a total disgrace. More than 17 million Brexit voters are entitled to be disgusted. Only a surge of support for UKIP can get the establishment parties back into line  as it has done before.   If Tory MPs vote with Labour on this issue they will be putting themselves in opposition to the people. The Referendum result was very clear: the British people voted to leave the European Union. This was not dependent on any ‘deal’  and the voters’ decision was not conditional in any way.   These MPs hope to start a guerrilla war in the Commons by trying to gum-up the works in order to delay Brexit  and  they hope  eventually stop us leaving us at all. They should accept the decision of the people and allow Mrs May to get on with the job.

We will keep them up. Even if they take them down. Are you with us?”  Jack Duffin  a UKIP councillor in Thurrock  wrote on Facebook: “I am embarrassed to be a councillor in Thurrock Council while we have an officer class who hate this country. Time for them to apologise or resign.”
UKIP Immigration Spokesman John Bickley:  UKIP believes in the widely admired British value of  fair play  and to that end will not be seeking the return of EU citizens legally settled in the UK before the June 23rd EU Referendum after we leave the EU.   The PM has made it clear that Article 50 will be triggered by March 2017. UKIP has no reason to believe that the number of EU migrants coming to the UK between the Referendum date (June 23rd 2016) and March 2017 will exceed historical averages  however UKIP reserves the right to review their right to stay here after we leave the EU because it s important that the UK government doesn t repeat the mistake made the German Chancellor  who gave the impression that  all  migrants were welcome to Germany & the EU. By creating a March 2017  sell by date  the government may unwittingly fuel unsustainable levels of EU migration to the UK.   Any EU national coming to the UK since the referendum result knew that the UK will be leaving  so their level of expectation is not the same as those who were here before the vote. EU citizens that come to the UK after Article 50 is triggered must understand that they cannot have any guarantees of a right to settle in the UK once we leave the EU.

Jane Collins MEP  “It is an outrage that despite an estimated 137 000 women being subjected to this horrific crime in England and Wales; no-one has been successfully prosecuted for an FGM offence.”  “FGM is nothing more than a brutal  disfiguring  and sometimes life-threatening form of child abuse  and anyone found to have been promoting or carrying out this barbaric practice should have the full weight of the law brought down upon them.  “It is time to end these brutal imported practises and to protect children from being disfigured in this most horrific way. Only by getting tough on the root causes of this vile crime will we see an end to this most horrific of acts.”
UKIP Leader Paul Nuttall MEP: Once we start signing trade deals across the rest of the world and stop looking inwards at a slow growing bloc that is the European Union and begin to look outwards to emerging markets in the East  Britain can become great again”  “We can become a very strong economy  and I think we will be a beacon of light to other countries in the European Union.  “I think after Brexit you might end up with a Frexit where France leaves  Dexit with the Danes  Nexit with the Dutch – I do believe that Brexit is just the beginning.”

FIFA s decision to fine the Home nations for wearing poppy armbands is an atrocious and profoundly wrong-headed decision from an organisation that appears to have lost its moral compass says UKIP s spokesman for Media and Sport Patrick O Flynn MEP.   The football associations of our Home nations are to be commended for honouring the sacrifice of previous generations at games played on and around Armistice Day.   It should not surprise us that FIFA have made such an appalling decision on this matter given their previous appalling decisions on matters such as the hosting of World Cup finals. When it comes to the governance of football  failings at a global level are even more marked than the failings we have seen in the domestic game.   FIFA has I am afraid become a byword for incompetence  greed and venality. The beautiful game deserves better than this.
UKIP Veterans Spokesman  Mike Hookem MEP  has blasted a decision by Judges not to release Sgt. Alex Blackman (known as Marine A) on bail saying   It is an absolute disgrace that a man who served his country so well  and who poses no risk to the public is denied the opportunity to spend Christmas with his family.   I think many people in the veterans community will be absolutely appalled at the treatment of  Sgt Blackman and rightly so. This is a man who deserves treatment  not prison. To me  this smacks of a political decision overriding common sense. I also feel for Mr Blackman s family who I know would have been looking forward to welcoming him home.   For me and the rest of the veteran community fighting on Mr Blackman s behalf  the struggle will go on until he is back in the arms of his family and receiving the treatment he needs  rather than remaining in prison. 
UKIP Leader Paul Nuttall MEP:  According to the Prime Minister’s timetable  the formal process of our leaving the EU will begin within the next three months. The Daily Express and UKIP must be the twin British bulldogs who make sure it does.   The PM has been so hesitant about taking and implementing decisions on everything from power stations to grammar schools that I hear she is now known as “Theresa Maybe” in some circles. When it comes to Brexit  that is just not good enough. Brexit mustn’t become another “maybe”  nor even a “definitely maybe”.   It must be a definite and it must be done and dusted well before the scheduled date of the next general election. A strong UKIP that has broadened its appeal and a Daily Express determined to see through its brilliant campaign can make sure that happens. Express delivery is now the name of the game. 
UKIP Immigration spokesman John Bickley:  It gives no one in UKIP any pleasure whatsoever to state  we warned you . Nigel Farage made it patently clear earlier this year that ISIS would use the refugee crisis and Merkel s  open door invite  to the Middle East to smuggle hundreds of jihadists into Europe.   The slaughter of innocents in Paris and Nice was no coincidence and the latest atrocity in Berlin shows that ISIS is now at war with Europe. The EU s continued support of Schengen and uncontrolled immigration both within and from outside the EU is both costing innocent lives  leaving hundreds with life threatening or life changing injuries and undermining social cohesion and our Judeo-Christian culture.   Only one Party in the UK has had the political courage to consistently warn of the dangers of uncontrolled immigration and the loss of sovereignty to the EU and that party is UKIP. History will judge that at a time of despair and tribulation only UKIP stood tall and was willing to fight for our hard fought for values and right to run our own affairs via a fully sovereign Parliament. 
A Christmas message from UKIP Leader Paul Nuttall MEP
Merry Christmas from Paul Nuttall MEP & all of UKIP
UKIP Media and Sport spokesman Patrick O’Flynn MEP: “Motor sport adds billions to the UK economy and is also a very popular spectator and participant activity in our country.  “Participants in all kinds of motor sport acknowledge the risks involved and we have seen great advances in safety standards over the years.  “It is therefore totally disproportionate for the Government even to contemplate implementing measures originating in the EU that could insure motor sport out of existence.”
Suzanne Evans UKIP Health Spokeswoman said   It comes as no surprise that NHS Trusts in England have made some £7 million more on parking charges this year  plus at least another £2 million in fines over the past four years. Hospital parking charges are a stealth tax on the sick and their carers  and UKIP agrees with the Patient Association: they are unfair and should be abolished.   In this day and age  it wouldn’t be difficult to ensure only those in need accessed free hospital parking to prevent misuse. If every other car park with a barrier in the country can manage it  using a token or other access system  then so can NHS trusts. A one-off visit may not affect one person all that much  but for those who need to make repeated visits  the sums can mount up  especially if you’re kept waiting before you’re seen. 
UKIP Leader Paul Nuttall MEP:  This has been a great year for western politics. There  I said it  and 2017 will be even better. Many commentators are beginning their year-end reviews in despair  speculating that 2016 could mark the start of a terminal descent into an unpredictable breakdown of everything that has kept us civilised and safe for the past 60 years  but I think for the main it has been a brilliant year. Brilliant for the people of Britain  and brilliant for the UK Independence party  as it happens.   In 2017  UKIP will continue to push for the Australian style points-based immigration system that the British public overwhelmingly wants. We will further define UKIP as the party of law and order  with zero tolerance on crime. We will argue for a meaningful reduction to the bloated  indefensible foreign aid budget  and we will argue for a better deal for veterans. 
UKIP s immigration spokesman John Bickley:  Today s report from Migration Watch makes it crystal clear that remaining in the EU s single market will mean the continuation of uncontrolled immigration.   Throughout the EU referendum campaign both sides made it utterly apparent that voting to leave the European Union meant leaving the single market.   These new forecasts show that failing to control immigration will result in a population explosion of 12 million in 25 years  equivalent to the entire current populations of Bulgaria and New Zealand (7.2 million and 4.6 million respectively). 
WATCH: UKIP Leader Paul Nuttall MEP s New Year Message
UKIP Immigration Spokesman John Bickley said   The revelation that a large percentage of child migrants are anything but  with many in their late 20 s is a disgrace and demonstrates the shambolic nature of the government s child refugee policy. Genuine child refugees have been cheated out a safe haven by government and civil service incompetence.   The number of people arriving in Britain and claiming to be lone refugee children has almost tripled in recent years  Home Office figures reveal  from 1 125 in 2012 to 3 253 in 2016 and yet we now learn that a significant percentage of them are adults. Can the government guarantee that they are not a threat to children and teenagers in schools and foster homes  or are supporters of ISIL taking advantage of what is clearly a shambolically executed child refugee policy to sneak into the UK to carry out atrocities? 
UK Independence Party (UKIP) updated their cover photo.
Gerard Batten MEP  UKIP s Brexit spokesman: “Sir Ivan had done the decent thing and stood down from an untenable position. If Mrs May were serious about leaving the EU she would have removed him long before.  “Mrs May should not fill this post with a new Ambassador until we have Repealed the European Communities Act (1972) and returned supremacy of law-making to the UK Parliament.  “Only when those matters are resolved should she appoint a new Ambassador to the EU. And that person should be there to represent Britain’s national interests to the EU  not represent the EU’s interests to Britain. Perhaps Nigel Farage would consider taking up the post? After all he ably demonstrated in the Referendum campaign that he knows more about the EU than any other British politician  and he can be relied upon to defend Britain’s interests”.
WATCH: UKIP Immigration Spokesman John Bickley on Sky News putting across the clear message that we are opposed to uncontrolled mass immigration.    Brexit was about taking back control 
UKIP transport spokesman Jill Seymour: “It’s no surprise that rail travellers are voicing their anger at these inflation-busting price rises. While their ticket prices continue to rise  the standard of customer service they are receiving continues to fall.  “Consecutive governments have either ignored or delayed improvements to our current rail network  and made many cutbacks – now they are expecting customers to pay for their mismanagement. While prices rise  we are seeing a reducing level of service in some areas  and total absence of reliability or consistency.  “No wonder people are unhappy – we should not be expected to have to pay a premium for an unacceptably poor standard of transport.”
Patrick O Flynn MEP:  As UKIP media spokesman  I strongly object to section 40 of the Crime and Courts Act. This astonishingly illiberal and illogical measure will mean that newspapers can be made to pay huge legal costs for the sin of telling the truth unless they agree to be regulated by the Government’s approved body. Any newspaper not signing up to the Impress body will have to pay legal costs for both sides in libel actions taken against it whether it wins or loses the case.   It would in effect hand to any wealthy individual or organisation the ability to close a newspaper down by taking multiple libel actions against it  no matter how spurious. Such a complainant would know that  win or lose  the newspaper would be on the hook for the huge legal costs of both sides. This situation would very quickly turn surviving newspapers into little more than public relations outlets for the powerful and the wealthy.   Section 40 should be dumped and freedom of the press preserved. 
UKIP Immigration Spokesman John Bickley said   Today s report from the All Party Parliamentary Group on Social Integration looks like an attempt by the Westminster establishment to con working class communities in thinking they re going to do something about controlling immigration  when we know that neither the Labour nor the Tory leadership has any such intent.   The report is also an admission that uncontrolled immigration is a problem but there is no apology to the British people from the liberal establishment for presiding over and encouraging it. Likewise  it’s a bit rich for that same political establishment  who have overseen and approved mass uncontrolled immigration to be attempting to close the gate after the horse has bolted. 
The Nigel Farage show will be on LBC radio weekdays from 7PM.  Click on the link below to find out more about the show and how you can listen in:
UKIP Leader Paul Nuttall MEP:  We are told that the Prime Minister is prepared to pull the UK out of the Single Market if the UK is not given full control of its borders and we are supposed to be impressed by this. Given that this is exactly what the 17 million voted for almost 7 months ago  given that it was clear throughout the campaign that this is what we were voting about it is extraordinary that it has taken her so long to say it.   Essentially all she is saying - for the hundredth time is that Brexit means Brexit. Yes Prime Minister we knew that. So get on with it. The British people and UK businesses need some certainty  and this shilly-shallying around  and the failure to instigate Article 50 in a timely fashion only empowers those who would subvert the popular will expressed so decisively last June.  “The public voted for a clean and complete Brexit  a simple concept that she could and should announce immediately. Anything less than that will be selling the public short on what they voted for  however hard she tries to make out it isn’t.”
If you agree with what UKIP Leader Paul Nuttall MEP had to say on LBC and want to ensure that Leave means Leave then do join UKIP today!
UKIP Leader Paul Nuttall MEP:  Surely Nigel Farage deserves a Knighthood. Without him there would have been no referendum and no Brexit.   Do you agree with Paul?
UKIP Home Affairs Spokeswoman  Jane Collins MEP  has blasted a call by Home Secretary  Amber Rudd  to introduce ID cards for EU citizens saying;  Time and again we have heard politicians use arguments ranging from terrorism  to benefit fraud  in order to justify their pipe dream of introducing a national ID card.  “The introduction of an ID card would be a draconian  ‘big brother’ move and there is simply no need for one  that’s why we have passports. What is wrong with having a simple visa stamp in a passport to differentiate between those who have the right to live and work in the UK and those who don’t.  “It is time politicians woke up and realised the British public have little appetite for the introduction of an ID card  whether it be for EU nationals or the wider public. It is a totally anti-libertarian move that is both undemocratic and unnecessary.”
UKIP s Bill Etheridge MEP believes a move back to the UK Government stamp  guaranteeing full and half-pint glasses are the correct size  could help revive Britain´s glass-making sector.   All drinkers remember the Crown mark  knowing that it guaranteed them a full pint  indeed there are still some around. Reintroduced gradually  as replacements  they are not a throwback to a nostalgic era  but a move to put us back in control of the production and specifications of our own pint.   “Across the whole range of manufacturing we have to look at returning to our own systems of British Standards as we unravel ourselves from EU red tape.”
UKIP Leader Paul Nuttall MEP   Despite being asked a simple and clear question on at least three occasions she declined to answer. Will she prioritise taking back control of our borders over membership of the European Single Market? Her answers were vague  muddy and ultimately opaque.  Move along nothing to see here  seems to be the PMs strategy   She gave herself more wriggle room than a snake in a barrel. It is just not good enough. It is clear what the people of the UK voted for in June  and it is clear that she will do anything she can to delay and prevaricate on this simple instruction from the electorate. There is no purpose in delay  no purpose in leaving the air thick with claim and counter claim. This merely leaves Britain s people and businesses with nothing to work with and little to base their planning on. It is not good enough. Enough already. She she make it clear that if we do not get what we want  decent trading relations with our continental friends and a clear decision to return full control of immigration to Westminster  then she should simply repeal the European Communities Act.

UKIP Leader Paul Nuttall MEP: Labour has betrayed millions of British families on immigration. It was Labour that threw open our jobs market to millions of Eastern Europeans with no transitional controls at all.   What Jeremy Corbyn is committing himself to today is not even worthy of the term  sticking plaster . For him to think stopping a few online job ads is going to have any real impact on the movement of people from the low wage economies of Eastern Europe is a joke.   The British people - and working class communities in particular - want full control restored over our borders so the volume of immigration can be brought down sharply.   That will ease the pressure on the NHS and other public services  on housing and community cohesion and give working people the prospect of a pay rise again after years of flatline wages. Only UKIP is offering this through our backing of a points system based on criteria that will slash migrant numbers.   If Jeremy Corbyn thinks working class voters will be fooled by the load of flannel he has come out with today then he has another thing coming. 
 Labour has betrayed millions of British families on immigration.    Jeremy Corbyn’s plan to ban British jobs being advertised abroad will have no significant impact. We need an Australian style points system.   Do you agree with UKIP Leader Paul Nuttall MEP?
UKIP’s Home Affairs Spokeswoman  Jane Collins MEP: “Only in the wake of yet another terror attack have some members of Angela Merkel’s coalition government woken up to the threat posed by a minority of the migrants who rushed to Germany after the Chancellor threw the doors wide open.”  “But while I welcome German efforts to tighten rules on migrants already in the country  these moves are next to useless in combating further attacks while the Schengen Agreement remains in place.  “Any policy which allows undocumented people to travel coast to coast in Europe unchecked poses a direct risk to the UK’s security and must be revoked. This is simply ridiculous and the EU must act to revoke this ridiculous policy  especially in the current security climate.”

UKIP London Assembly Member David Kurten:  The Jockey Club  the local council and the government all need to think again. If we keep on concreting over our green belt and national treasures  there will soon be none left. 
UKIP Immigration Spokesman John Bickley:  One of Labour s senior MPs  David Lammy tells us that politicians are “detached” from mass swathes of the public  yet his own actions confirm that he is one of those  detached  politicians. He wants the referendum to be rerun and he voted against the triggering of Article 50  so both the words hypocrite and sore loser come to mind.   And if Labour s deluded thinking wasn t bad enough  we have the Tory Party s Immigration Minister proposing to slap a £1 000  fine  on any company recruiting workers from outside the EU  with the possibility of extending the punishment to EU workers after Brexit.    Instead of the Tory Party thrashing about because of their incompetence in bringing immigration down to the  tens of thousands  why don t they just get on with controlling non EU immigration in a fair and equitable fashion by using an Australian type points based system. If they re incapable of doing so then can they call a general election and let UKIP deliver the will of the people on Brexit and begin the overdue process of getting our out of control immigration system under control .
LISTEN: UKIP Leader Paul Nuttall MEP -  The future for the UK outside the EU is very bright. Theresa May needs to ensure we get full Brexit. 
UKIP s fisheries spokesman Mike Hookem:  This research proves what a bright future the fishing industry can have if we return British waters to British fisherman!   We have known for years what a poor deal British fishermen got from the EU and these figures prove beyond doubt how the traditional parties have betrayed fishermen and coastal communities alike. 
Statement from Paul Oakden  UKIP Chairman:  The resignation of Tristram Hunt MP highlights the brighter future that many in the Labour Party feel they have away from Jeremy Corbyn and his brand of politics.    We have no doubt that the example set by Mr Hunt will be one that many voters in Stoke-on-Trent will consider following in the upcoming by-election  where UKIP will be fighting hard to offer local people the committed representation they both need and deserve.   UKIP will confirm the selection of it s candidate on Saturday 21st January. 
As Nigel Farage says  many countries want to start trade talks with Britain. The sooner the better. What is the Prime Minister waiting for?
If Donald Trump and the USA want to do a trade deal with Britain now  why are we still letting Brussels tell us what to do?
UKIP Leader Paul Nuttall MEP gives his reaction to the Prime Minister s speech today: Some of it did sound like a UKIP conference speech and the Prime Minister is now applying some of the things that we’ve been talking about for many  many years  so I would give her seven out of ten for this effort.   As Home Secretary  Theresa May always talked tough but failed to deliver. I challenge her to change the habit of a political lifetime and actually deliver this time. And I mean on time and in full.

Love Stoke  Vote UKIP. Vote Paul Nuttall MEP for Stoke-on-Trent Central

 I am asking the people of Stoke-on-Trent Central to lend me their support so we finish the job on Brexit  bring our money home and secure our borders. Things have really got to change.   With one of the largest Leave votes in last year’s Referendum  Stoke is already the capital city of Brexit  we can together make it the capital of change.   Love Stoke  vote UKIP.  - Paul Nuttall MEP
Having forced the British establishment to give the people the right to decide on taking back political control from an emerging United States of Europe  UKIP can now make the traditional virtues of civic and national pride powerful forces for good in our society once more.   We will be making the argument in the weeks ahead for reducing the foreign aid budget by billions and ploughing that money into helping our NHS and solving the crisis in social care for the elderly. I am convinced that the best way to assist developing countries is not to keep them on a drip feed of aid that often props up corrupt regimes  but instead to open up our markets to their produce by signing free trade deals with them --- Paul Nuttall MEP  Share this if you agree with Paul and UKIP s common sense proposals.
In the Stoke Central by-election UKIP will be campaigning for jobs and housing for local people  for strong law and order  and against mass uncontrolled immigration.
Quite simply  Labour  especially the Labour of Corbyn and Abbott and Thornberry  has betrayed the English working class says UKIP Leader Paul Nuttall MEP    Labour s leadership hate the idea of English national identity and their continued support for open door immigration and crude multiculturalism has undermined social solidarity.
WATCH: We’re handing over money in foreign aid to countries that are richer than ourselves. That money could be spent on our schools and hospitals says Paul Nuttall MEP
UKIP Leader Paul Nuttall MEP has said the Supreme Court s decision to deny the Government s appeal and insist that Parliament vote on the triggering of Article 50 would not jeopardise Brexit.   This decision is hardly a surprise but in the end it will make no real difference. The will of the people will be heard  and woe betide those politicians or parties that attempt to block  delay  or in any other way subvert that will.    Other than making clear that this is a decision of the whole United Kingdom  rather than its constituent parts  what we can clearly see is that it will embolden those who rail against the decision of the people. It may give heart to those in the EU  used as they are to ignoring their own people  to attempt to play hard ball in the negotiations.    But in the end I am convinced that though this skirmish has been lost in the courts  the war will be won.

 The NHS needs a short  sharp cash injection and we re the only party that ll say where it ll come from. It ll come from the foreign aid budget  which is now costing the British people £30 million a day. I bet you if you polled people up and down the country — particularly in this constituency — and asked them  do you want a foreign aid budget that s going to cost £15 billion by the end of this parliament given to countries which in some cases are richer than ourselves? or do you want it to be spent on the NHS? I m telling you: 100% would rather it spent on the NHS and that s UKIP s policy.   - Paul Nuttall MEP
UK Independence Party (UKIP) shared Peter Whittle AM s post.
UKIP Defence Spokesman Bill Etheridge: ”Figures I have seen show that the British Army is struggling to reach its recruitment needs  with the average across the infantry line reaching only 45 per cent in November of last year.    This means that jobs are not done or soldiers have double jobs. Yet we see that instead of addressing the shortfall in recruits  the government has targets for women and BAME recruitment where a military career holds less appeal rather than on getting the vacancies filled by people who can pass the course and want to serve their country.

Labour cannot be trusted to protect the health service says UKIP Leader Paul Nuttall
WATCH: UKIP Leader Paul Nuttall MEP and Suzanne Evans set out our stall on the NHS.  UKIP has never and will never – under Paul Nuttall s leadership – enter any election calling for the privatisation of the NHS. Full stop.
Defence Spokesman Bill Etheridge:  For too many years  the job of defending our country has been Cinderella with the ugly sisters of foreign aid and throwing money at unreformed projects soaking up billions of taxpayers money. Report after report has shown the Ministry of Defence is not fit for purpose yet Mr Cameron rewarded the Secretary of State for Defence with a knighthood  probably for backing  remain  in the referendum.   It is clear to me that our Armed Forces are woefully underfunded with rock bottom morale and a crisis in recruitment. We could not defend ourselves against an attack from a country like Russia and we have spent the last few years running down our defences at the expense of tying ourselves into arrangements with other countries  predominantly France  and yet still acting as global policeman following the disastrous Blair doctrine of interfering internationalism.    It is time defence of the realm was the government s number one priority and that means proper equipment  stopping the harassment of our troops by IHAT and a massive uplift in defence spending. 
UKIP Leader Paul Nuttall MEP:  Labour may well have founded the NHS in 1948  but today they have come to resemble an abusive parent.   I refuse to be hectored by a party that oversaw the Mid Staffs scandal. A scandal for which no one in senior management was sacked! I refuse to be lectured to by a party that allowed MRSA to become commonplace on our wards. I refuse to be accused of wanting to privatise the NHS by a party that actually did privatise 5% of our health service when they were in power.   I also refuse to take criticism from a party whose two most prominent members of the House of Lords – Winston and Warner – have called for people to be charged to see their GP. And finally  I refuse to take lessons from a party that has saddled the NHS with a debt of nearly 80 billion pounds through the signing of crazy PFI contracts.   I now want to make something crystal clear: UKIP has never and will never – under my leadership – enter any election calling for the privatisation of the NHS. Full stop. I want to repeat this: UKIP will never – under my leadership – enter any election calling for the privatisation of the NHS. Period.

Despite robust legislation existing to stop this abuse from occurring  there has not been a single conviction in all that time.  “The practice is barbaric and is something we should  as a society  make clear is not acceptable under any circumstances and politically correct cultural sensitivities be damned.  “I support the United Nations call and the campaigns to end this practice and end it quickly.”

Accident and emergency patients in England experienced the worst month of delays this winter in the 13 years since the four-hour target was introduced  a leaked document suggests. The figures  compiled by regulator NHS Improvement  also reportedly suggest a record high for people waiting more than 12 hours for a bed after being seen in A&E.  The target  introduced in 2004  states that 95% of patients must be seen and either admitted or discharged in under four hours. But the document suggests that of 1.4 million visits in January  only 82% were dealt with within the time frame - while more than 60 000 people waited for up to 12 hours for a bed after being told they must be admitted.

On BBC Question Time tonight on BBC 1 at 10:45pm will be UKIP Deputy Leader Peter Whittle AM.  Make sure you tune in!
The full agenda for next week s Spring Conference in Bolton has now been finalised - http://www.ukip.org/conference_agenda - and we are pleased to say that it is packed with the Party s talent. Within a single day on Friday 17th February we will have our Leader  Paul Nuttall MEP  our former leader  Nigel Farage as well as a raft of policy spokesmen.   The next day we journey to Stoke to help Paul Nuttall s bid to win that crucial by-election on February 23.  So please  make sure you book your tickets now and encourage others to do likewise as we head towards this momentous couple of days. We are really in place to make history  and we d love you to be part of it. We ll see you next week!
UKIP Defence Spokesman Bill Etheridge MEP: “This story underlines two vital points that I have been making over the last few weeks. Firstly  that under-investment in our military capacity has left the cupboard bare - the slightest problem exposes the lack of back-up. Secondly  our defence procurement  headed by Tony Douglas  on a salary and bonus package in excess of £500k a year is definitely sub-standard.  “We now have ships that break down in warm water  aircraft carriers with no aircraft and not a single serviceable submarine.  “Quite honestly the man should do the honourable thing and resign. He has failed the troops  failed the tax-payer and failed the country!”
UKIP MP Douglas Carswell: “Leaving the EU should mean leaving the jurisdiction of the European courts  but if this proposal is allowed to pass  and we sign up to the Unified Patent Court Agreement  then we will still find ourselves subject to judges at the European Court of Justice in Luxembourg when it comes to intellectual property.  “We would be required to accept the supremacy of EU law in its entirety with regard to any disputes within the jurisdiction of the UPC  including competition law  fundamental rights arising under the Charter  as well as any specific patent rules contained within EU Directives.   “How countries protect intellectual property is also often a key issue when negotiating trade deals  so allowing the EU to decide these matters for us will make it much harder for the UK to negotiate the free trade deals we need with big dynamic economies outside Europe.  “No wonder the Europhiles wanted to pass this into law under the radar  without proper debate. It has the potential to drive a huge stake into the heart of Brexit.”
Veterans are finishing top of housing waiting lists and still not getting a roof over their heads because the Armed Forces Covenant is simply not working. The Covenant  signed by every local authority  is supposed to give military heroes priority housing and health care – but not only are veterans being forced to sleep rough  they are waiting years for treatment for mental problems caused by their stint in the forces.  There is £30m worth of funding made available by Government  but many councils are not even applying for it  despite desperate  traumatised veterans begging for help.  Sign the Homes for Heroes petition to force the Government to look after our brave veterans: https://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/182429
“It is a matter of priorities and what I find at the moment morally reprehensible  is that we are facing this situation in this wonderful institution of the NHS  at the same time that we are sending abroad twelve to sixteen billion a year in foreign aid.   We would bring foreign aid spending down to about 0.2 per cent  which would mean part of it would go into the National Health Service and part of it into social care.   Do you agree with UKIP s Deputy Leader Peter Whittle? Should we prioritise OUR NHS over foreign aid to countries like India and China who have their own space programmes?

UKIP Brexit Spokesman Gerard Batten MEP:  Labour stopped representing the working class a long time ago. Stoke Central needs Paul as their MP so that he can speak up for their interests and for the regeneration of Stoke-on-Trent.   Brexit is in danger of being betrayed  and who better to demand a speedy exit from the EU in the House of Commons than than UKIP s Leader.   The 70% of Stoke s voters who voted to leave the EU will endanger that decision if they elect another Labour MP.

Memos leaked to a British newspaper state that “MEPs have drafted seven provisions to be included in Britain’s “exit agreement”  including the stipulation that there will be “no increase to the UK’s share of fishing opportunities for jointly fished stocks*.”  Speaking of the leaked memos  UKIP Fisheries Spokesman Mike Hookem said  “This is nothing more than the EU wanting to have their cake and eat it.

Well  in that case  it should work both ways  and UK waters must return to UK control regardless of what the EU want!”  “Anything less than getting back full control of our waters post-Brexit will be another utter betrayal of the fishing industry. Fishermen knew in 1972 that their industry had been stolen from them by politicians desperate to get into the EEC ‘club’ and Brexit is our opportunity to retake control our waters. 
UKIP Leader Paul Nuttall MEP:  We can replace Labour as the patriotic voice of working people  and we will do so. It will take time but we can make that first step on February the 23rd – and I genuinely believe that we will.  “If people go out and vote for Labour again and get a Labour MP  nothing will change. It will be the same  time and time again. It will be a voice in the wilderness. It will be lobby fodder.  “I guarantee  and I say this to the residents  If you go out and vote for me – things will change and things will change quickly.   Will you be coming to Stoke to help get Paul elected to Parliament?
UKIP Defence Spokesman Bill Etheridge:  With the twin threats of Islamic fundamentalism and a resurgent Russia  it is imperative that all NATO nations meet or exceed the agreed 2%.   We have a crisis in Armed Forces recruitment despite government protestations there is no problem. We have a severe lack of heavy artillery  of operational submarines  carriers without aircraft and insufficient infantry fighting vehicles.   The UK should not be in a position where an uplift in GDP means we miss our 2% target. We should be spending much more than that because we have a ground to make up after years of deficiencies. Unfortunately after years of Blairite internationalism where we send our troops to everyone else s conflicts and the mistaken belief that spending billions on foreign aid is better than defence spending  we have insufficient numbers of armed forces who are not properly equipped  and a Defence procurement system which is not fit for purpose.”
UKIP Deputy Leader Peter Whittle exclusively interviewed by Westmonster ahead of today s Spring Conference:  I don’t want to live in a country where a highly successful young Olympian messes around and finds himself on trial by media with his career threatened simply because he was mocking a religion.

Labour have taken the people of the UK  in places like Stoke-on-Trent and Copeland  for granted. Labour s mass immigration policies have put untold pressure on housing  parents struggle to get the right school place for their children and A&E waiting times are too long.  All Labour do is trash our country  sneer at our flag and Jeremy Corbyn refuses to sing the national anthem. They would rather give back the Falklands than build one more Council house; they would prosecute British servicemen rather than condemn the IRA and keep Britain in the EU while ignoring the wishes of the British people.
UKIP Scotland MEP David Coburn has slammed the SNP’s plot to keep Scotland in the EU and labelled Nicola Sturgeon s plans as “tosh”.   “It can’t happen. I had a meeting with President Schulz and he said quite clearly  and he’d just had a meeting with her  and he did not agree to anything.  “Britain came in as one country and it has to leave as such. He doesn’t want the Balkanisation of the UK.  “What she is saying is tosh  she’s misleading the Scottish people. It’s just not possible.

Britain will be dragged into its most serious constitutional crisis for over a century if the House of Lords tinkers with Brexit says UKIP Leader Paul Nuttall.   What we have here is the least democratic forum in British politics potentially interfering with the most democratic one - the result of a referendum. The British people have made their choice. For the Lords - which is stuffed with pro-EU timeservers and from which UKIP has been systematically excluded - to mess around with it would be both outrageous and dangerous.   The arrogance of Labour peers such as Lord Mandelson and Lord Hain is breath-taking. Unelected figures who set themselves against the will of the people are being grossly irresponsible.

UKIP Defence Spokesman Bill Etheridge   These repeated compensation payments are funding terrorism.  “With the recent cases opened about former servicemen and their actions in theatres of war  to the tank-chasing lawyers and now compensation paid to former detainees  we have seen too much money wasted. These are funds that should have gone towards defending our citizens.  “The United States would not have gone through all the time  trouble and international criticism if they had not suspected the detainees were capable of committing atrocities.  “It is time to stop the thinking that there is good in everyone and realise that there are people out there that wish to do us harm.”
UKIP’s Staffordshire MEP Jill Seymour:  Our message to the Stoke Central electorate is clear – we will not take the people for granted  as the Labour party has done now for too many years.   Uncontrolled immigration has put huge pressure on the city’s housing  waiting times at hospitals are too long  and many parents are struggling to get the right school places for their children.   These are the kind of issues which are important to the working class people of Stoke on Trent – not party political grandstanding in Westminster. And Paul Nuttall is a man who appreciates and understands them. 
The Brexit referendum victory has put Britain on a new trajectory – an exciting new path that will allow our country much more freedom to tackle its problems and to seek out new opportunities in the wider world. We are a great country  but one with many problems and frustrations.  Our new policy document   New Path for Britain  has begun to determine our direction of travel in several key policy areas – identifying what the challenges are and some key changes we need to see.  The purpose of it is to set out that broad direction of travel so that the British people can see that under Paul Nuttall s leadership UKIP is going to be the patriotic party that advances common-sense solutions to many of the problems that are holding them back in their lives.

 UKIP have been saying for years that all students who are foreign nationals  including those from the EU  should pay their own University fees up front if they are studying in Britain. This is simple common sense.   This is money which should all have been recovered  and could have paid for 15 brand new secondary schools. There is no excuse for this waste to continue: British money should be spent first on British people and services in this country  particularly in skills training for young people which has been neglected for far too long.

UKIP Economy Spokesman Mark Reckless AM said: “The Conservatives have today lost any claim they may have had to represent either White Van Man or the many women who create businesses as a route to combining a continuing economic contribution with family life.  “In this Budget  Philip Hammond has launched an unnecessary and foolish attack on enterprise. To claim to be making life better for the employed by making life worse for the self-employed is the worst kind of levelling down. It is an approach more befitting of big state socialism than of a party that claims to understand wealth creation.  “Self-employed people create their own jobs. They have no paid holidays  sickness benefits or company pension schemes and in fact no guaranteed income at all.  “They show guts and determination. And like the rest of the electorate they were promised that the Tories would not be whacking up national insurance rates in this parliament. In their case it is going to be a promise broken.”
Watch London Assembly Member David Kurten praise Kellyanne Conway on Women s Day.
UKIP Leader Paul Nuttall MEP:  After the Budget legions of White Van Men and hundreds of thousands of women who have set up their own businesses were left in no doubt: this government is not on their side. And to add insult to injury  Hammond s plans for higher NI for the self-employed were announced just minutes after he boasted about bringing down Corporation Tax for big multinational businesses.   Yet again the Conservative Party is advertising its historic weakness: it is the party for the already wealthy and well-connected  not a party for the strivers and the aspirational.

David Coburn MEP:  The prospect of a second independence referendum between the Autumn of 2018 and the spring of 2019 is utterly preposterous. The UK will still be in negotiations with the EU at this time – the SNP seem to wish to cause maximum disruption  uncertainty and overall mayhem.   In 2014 the Scottish people decided decisively to remain British  in 2016 less people voted to remain in the EU than voted to be British in 2014.   The SNP want to be “in control” not at the “mercy”  have they been asleep whilst Greece has simply been bullied by the EU and when The Republic of Ireland twice voted the wrong way in a referendum and were forced to vote again courtesy of the EU.   They would rather be ruled from Frankfurt and Berlin rather than Edinburgh and London. Scotland’s Education system is failing  roads are crumbling and the NHS has seen better days – therefore they must revert to these diversionary tactics. 
UKIP Leader Paul Nuttall MEP will be speaking live in the European Parliament. Tune in at the link below from around 09.40am...
UKIP Leader Paul Nuttall: “What began as a noble economic plan has evolved into a political monster  egged on by successive eurocrats who are hungry for ever more power and determined to destroy the nation state and what continues to amaze me is that you never learn. You talk about an existential crisis but you say what is needed is even more EU  you are fiddling whilst the Treaty of Rome burns.”
UKIP Veterans Spokesman Mike Hookem  has welcomed a decision by the Court Martial Appeal Court to reduce the sentence of jailed Royal Marine Sergeant  Alexander Blackman  saying; “the reduction in the severity of the charge against Al Blackman proves he should never have been jailed in the first place due to medical problems he was suffering from at the time of the incident.”  Former commando engineer  Mr Hookem  who has taken the campaign to free ‘Marine A  to the European Parliament said  “I would now like to see the immediate release of Mr Blackman and his sentence reduced to time served. Mr Blackman needs to be at home with his wife and family  where he belongs  rather than languishing in jail.
 It is increasingly clear that the party of the drivers  the strivers and the entrepreneurs is UKIP. 
UKIP Leader Paul Nuttall has denounced Tony Blair over the former PM s attempt to overthrow the referendum result.   Blair has demonstrated his arrogant belief that he and his supporters have special access to knowledge again. It was this mistaken belief that took the country into illegal war  maybe he should have learned his lesson.   I should be grateful though  every time Blair turns up on our screens or in our papers he reminds people of the reasons that they voted to free the country from the grip of people like him.   As Brexit comes to be a reality we will see the advantages of our decision. We will no longer be expecting  as Blair did and amazingly still does  the creation of a mythological  reformed EU   a prospect as likely as finding Atlantis off the mouth of Medway.   Blair was wrong then  he is wrong now and from what he is saying plans to remain wrong for the foreseeable future. Like an old tired aristocrat  he has learned nothing from the Referendum  yet forgotten nothing from his years of pomp.

UKIP Leader Paul Nuttall MEP:  A terrible attack on our democracy has taken place today. My thoughts tonight go out to the victims of this terrorist atrocity and their families.   Once again the emergency services have demonstrated the extraordinary work they do on our behalf. That a police officer is among the dead underlines the debt of gratitude we all owe those who work to keep us safe.   In the coming hours and days more information will doubtlesly emerge about the attacker or attackers and their motivation. In the meantime everyone should resolve that terrorism will never beat us. 
UKIP Leader Paul Nuttall:  Though we now know that the individual concerned was born in the UK this shows that we clearly have an integration crisis. It is time for the Government to actually start confronting practices that are dividing off Muslim communities; FGM  sharia tribunals  first cousin marriage  forced marriage  so-called  honour  violence etc etc. All are unacceptable in Britain.   UKIP will be the party that tells it as it is on these issues. We are on a disastrous path because of political correctness from establishment politicians.   We remember PC Palmer and his sacrifice  and send our thoughts and prayers to all the innocents from the UK and around the world affected by this act of terrorism.    But while we do so we must act efficiently and quietly to ensure that this cannot happen again. Fine words are not enough .

UKIP Leader Paul Nuttall writes   As you will know  Douglas Carswell has announced today that he is resigning from UKIP  to sit as an independent MP. He has said that he is doing this “cheerfully and amicably”.    This is not a surprise. I was elected on a pledge to forge unity in the party  and have had many discussions with key players to try and make that happen  but it had become increasingly clear to me that some things were simply beyond reach.   Douglas was genuinely committed to Brexit  but was never a comfortable Ukipper. On Monday  he had been due to meet with the National Executive Committee to answer various questions relating to longstanding issues  including published allegations that he had joined us in order to try to minimise Nigel Farage’s involvement in the Referendum.    Douglas’s defection to UKIP in 2014  along with Mark Reckless  and the two by-elections we fought successfully for them  proved that UKIP was capable of getting members elected to Parliament – albeit  it was still a tough task (as I know only too well  personally).   Our party has not benefited financially or organisationally from having Douglas in Westminster. With this in mind  his departure will make no difference to my ability or focus on delivering the reforms I promised when elected as Leader.   As we redefine our mission and take up the next phase of our campaign to rebuild a confident  independent nation  Douglas would have been increasingly out of kilter with our members’ aspirations.    We now have an opportunity to put behind us the most damaging internal conflict which has dogged us over the past year  and look forward with optimism and unity of purpose to the very real challenges of policing Brexit and further reforming the vigorous democracy of the UK. 
UKIP Leader Paul Nuttall: As far as the party is concerned  we can now put behind us one of the most damaging internal conflicts which has dogged us over the past year.  We can look forward with optimism and unity of purpose to the very real challenges of policing Brexit and further reforming the vigorous democracy of the UK.We can and will put forward a raft of proposals that will show the hard pressed patriotic working people that they are no longer forgotten and they have a champion. And we can do this confident that we will not suffer the embarrassment of a high profile dissenter.  I imagine most of the Ukip membership will initially be angry  with a sense of betrayal  but soon be breathing a sigh of relief. I wouldn’t be surprised if a few of them tweeted a smiley face or two.

In my opinion  Sgt Blackman should never have been in prison in the first place  so today’s news is most welcome.”  “But while recognise that Alex’s release is a victory for justice  I think lessons need to be learned about how the military investigate and prosecute troops and veterans accused of potential war-crimes moving forward.  “The simple fact is  it should not have taken a long-running and high-profile campaign to get real justice for a serving member of our armed forces and we cannot allow a repetition of this situation.

The statement put out today by the EU setting out their guidelines for negotiating with the UK over the next two years is  bound to create more division amongst EU nations   said Paul Nuttall/    By wrapping the negotiations in a bureaucratic straitjacket all that they guarantee to do is highlight the already glaring differences of approach amongst the rump 27 nations in the bloc.   It is beholden on the UK government to get the best deal possible for the people of this country. To do so will require patience  flexibility  good will and imagination. Sadly none of these qualities are visible in the EU position paper. It appears that they have neither learned anything from the Brexit result  nor have they any desire so to do .

At the same time  we must also vow not to let our lives be dictated by the terrorist – the world will never submit to the terror of the bomb and the gun  no matter what. Good will always prevail over evil.”

UKIP’s Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs spokesman James Carver MEP:  I find it incredible that shortly after the Spanish Foreign Minister has called for calm  the Spanish government order their warship to illegally enter British sovereign territory in an attempt to frighten and bully the people of Gibraltar.   I am not surprised  however this is the 100th incursion since 2014  and follows a pattern of Spanish contempt for the Law of the Sea and more widely  international agreements that do not suit their narrow  self -serving agenda”.
Paul Nuttall  the UKIP leader has condemned the missile attack on Syria as   rash  trigger happy  nonsensical and will achieve nothing.    The whole world rightly condemns the use of chemical weapons in Syria  but the US attack on the Assad regime does nothing to lower tensions  nor will it hasten peace in that country.   Too often rash responses to horrific situations are about the conscience of the attacker  rather than a clear-headed response to an awful situation.   There are currently no good options in Syria. Assad or ISIS is not a choice anyone would wish to make. But firing off missiles in an enraged response shows weakness not strength in the face of horror.   I hoped for better from this administration.

UKIP Leader Paul Nuttall:  So while the cosy establishment are peddling a line that our inaction over Syria means we are culpable for some of the blame of what has happened there  they don’t seem to realise that the wrong type of action would lead to something far worse.  The establishment media used to make huge play of referring to IS as ‘the so called Islamic State’  but if Assad is forced to leave in the chaotic way that other leaders have been ousted  IS will soon have its own nation. Then we’ll be fighting them over here and the saddest thing is that it will be all our own fault.

UKIP Leader Paul Nuttall :  Punishment for wrong-doing and deterring other potential offenders are two absolute bedrock purposes of the prison system.    For Liz Truss to come up with a mission statement that leaves out both beggars belief and suggests she has had the wool pulled over her eyes by so-called  progressive  penal policy pressure groups.   By not specifically referencing  punishment  in the statement  it could allow governors further to soften regimes in prisons so that they become more like holiday camps rather than serious corrective institutions.

 I think the time has come to tell Turkey once and for all that she will not and never will join the European Union whilst Erdogan is at the helm. Then I believe we must then have a full and frank discussion as to whether Turkey should be allowed to remain a member of NATO. It needs to be made clear to President Erdogan that his actions have consequences. And he must be made to understand that if he continues to stamp out democracy and shift his country in the direction of resembling a Middle Eastern theocracy  then the gates the West will close  and close very rapidly indeed.    Do you agree with UKIP Leader Paul Nuttall?
UKIP Leader Paul Nuttall:  We welcome the opportunity to take UKIP s positive message to the country.   However  we believe that the Prime Minister s decision to call this election is a cynical decision driven more by the weakness of Corbyn s Labour Party rather than the good of the country. There is also the prospect of a slew of Tory held by-elections caused by the seeming systematic breach of electoral law at the last election  predominantly in places where UKIP were pressing the Conservatives hard.   We are in the midst of Brexit negotiations so this election will provide a perfect opportunity for the 52% to vote for UKIP the only party wholeheartedly committed to a clean quick and efficient Brexit.

The Integration Agenda
UKIP Leader Paul Nuttall:  Yet again it appears that UKIP speaks while other parties dither and  as with Brexit we are laughed at  derided and held in contempt. It’s alright  we are used to it  we can cope  but we were right over Brexit and we are right about this. Right now  the coddled elite are laughing at us  but that will change  and we will be proud to have lead this debate as we have lead others before.   As that famous quote goes  ‘First they ignore you  then they laugh at you  then they fight you  then you win.’ Guess what? They laughed at us 15 years ago when we talked about EU withdrawal  and we well know what happened next. 
UKIP Leader Paul Nuttall said: “Mrs May doesn’t have much of a Brexit plan to start with but Labour’s plans are even worse than hers.  “Mrs May intends to fudge exit so we leave in name but not in reality  Labour’s plan is to not even pretend to have left. Under their plans  we might as well not even bother. This is as near as you can get to staying in without remaining within the EU.  “Their fixation on going back and back to Parliament is merely cover for a desire to block Brexit and at best will hearten the EU to play the hardest ball possible during the next two years of negotiations.  “UKIP is the only party with a policy for leaving the EU quickly  cleanly and completely. Brexit must mean Exit.”

The Public Accounts Committee report on fraud in the International Aid budget was scathing about the dismissive attitude to fraud displayed by both the Foreign and International Development departments which suggested that there was no significant problem with fraud.  Lisa Duffy  UKIP s Foreign Aid spokesman said   As the Committee made clear  it isn t good enough to wave a hand and claim not to be able to divulge who is committing the fraud  it is imperative that people are able to know who is stealing their hard earned taxes.   That the Committee itself seems to accept that there are both  legal and cultural sensitivities  in divulging the identities of the fraudsters is equally worrying.   We have our own cultural sensitivity here in the UK  the one in which tax payers money is accounted for and accountable.   This report highlights one of the reasons why it is outrageous that the Government has committed itself to the .7% target of GDP to be spent on foreign aid. We should slash the budget keeping only humanitarian  disaster relief and clean water projects and repatriate the taxpayers money back to where it can help those taxpayers  here in the UK .

UKIP has long warned that the EU soft soap would start to take effect. We believe that if we handle the negotiations this way  by abandoning key aspects of legal and constitutional independence we will open ourselves up to even greater demands from the EU. Who hands over a strategic goal without a fight?   Why should our taxpayers  money be used to molly coddle the whims of the EU. British law or should I say England and Wales law with slight variations in Scotland should be our law not a soft option mixture with the EU. So here we start  does Brexit mean Brexit? Seemingly not. UKIP will fight and ensure that we are the guard dogs of Brexit.
